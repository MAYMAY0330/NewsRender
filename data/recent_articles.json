Fraud related to the Indian government’s instant payment system UPIgrew 85% year-over-yearto nearly 11 billion Indian rupees ($127 million) last year, per the government’s data. India also saw several instances of digital arrest scams, where fraudsters pose as officials to extort money via video calls and predatory loan apps.\nWith its Safety Charter, Google aims to address some of these areas. The company has also launched itssecurity engineering centerin India, its fourth center after Dublin, Munich, and Malaga.\nAnnounced at the Google for India summit last year, the security engineering center (GSec) will allow Google to partner with the local community, including government, academia and students, and small and medium enterprises to create solutions to solve cybersecurity, privacy, safety, and AI problems, said Google VP of security engineering Heather Adkins in an interview with TechCrunch.\nGoogle has partnered with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to raise awareness of cybercrimes, the company said in a blog post. This builds upon the company’s existing work, including the launch of its online fraud identification program,DigiKavach, which debuted in 2023 to restrict the harmful effects of malicious financial apps and predatory loan apps.\nWith its GSec in India, Google will focus on three key areas, Adkins told TechCrunch: the phenomenon of online scams and fraud and how people are safe online; the cybersecurity of enterprises, government, and critical infrastructure; and building responsible AI.\n“These three areas will become part of our safety charter for India, and over the coming years… we want to use the fact that we have engineering capability here to solve for what’s happening in India, close to where the users are,” said Adkins.\nGlobally, Google is utilizing AI to combat online scams and remove millions of ads and ad accounts. The company aims to deploy AI more extensively in India to combat digital fraud.\nGoogle Messages, which comes preinstalled on many Android devices, uses AI-powered Scam Detection that has helped protect users from over 500 million suspicious messages a month. Similarly, Googlepiloted its Play Protectin India last year, which it claims has blocked nearly 60 million attempts to install high-risk apps, resulting in the stopping of more than 220,000 unique apps on over 13 million devices. Google Pay, which isone of the top UPI-based payment appsin the country, also displayed 41 million warnings against transactions suspected to be potential scams.\n—\nAdkins, a founding member of Google’s security team who has been part of the internet company for over 23 years, discussed several other topics during an interview with TechCrunch:\nAdkins said one thing top of mind is the use and misuse of AI by malicious actors.\n“We’re obviously tracking AI very closely, and up until now, we’ve mostly seen the large language models like Gemini used as productivity enhancements. For example, to make phishing scams a bit more effective — especially if the actor and the target have different languages — they can use the benefit of translation to make the scams more believable using deepfakes, images, video, etc.,” said Adkins.\nAdkins said Google is conducting extensive testing of its AI models to ensure they understand what they should not do.\n“This is important for generated content that might be harmful, but also actions that it might take,” said Akins.\nGoogle is working on frameworks, including theSecure AI Framework, to restrict the abuse of its Gemini models. However, to protect generative AI from being misused and abused by hackers in the future, the company sees the need for a framework to build safety for how multiple agents communicate.\n“The industry is moving very, very quickly [by] putting protocols out. It’s almost like the early days of the internet, where everybody’s releasing code in real time, and we’re thinking about safety after the fact,” said Adkins.\nGoogle does not want to introduce merely its own frameworks to limit the scope of generative AI being abused by hackers. Instead, Adkins said the company is working with the research community and developers.\n“One of the things you don’t want to do is constrain yourself too much in the early research days,” said Adkins.\nAlongside generative AI’s potential for abuse by hackers, Adkins sees commercial surveillance vendors as a significant threat. These can include spyware makers, includingNSO Group, which isinfamous for its Pegasus spyware, or other small enterprises selling surveillance tools.\n“These are companies spun up all over the world, and they develop and make and sell a platform for hacking,” said Adkins. “You might pay $20, you might pay $200,000, just depending on the sophistication of the platform, and it allows you to scale attacking people without any expertise on your own.”\nSome of these vendors also sell their tools tospy on people in markets, including India. However, apart from being targeted by surveillance tools, the country has its own unique challenges in part for its size. The country sees not only AI-led deepfakes and voice cloning frauds, but also instances ofdigital arrests, which Adkins underlines are just regular scams adapted for the digital world.\n“You can see how quickly the threat actors themselves are advancing… I love studying cyber in this region because of that. It’s often a hint of what we’re going to see worldwide at some point,” said Adkins.\nGoogle has long encouraged its users to use more secure authentication methods beyond passwords to protect their online presence. The company switched on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts in the past, and also promotes hardware-based security keys, which Adkins mentioned by pointing to its employees actively using their laptops. Passwordless is alsobecoming a popular tech term, with various meanings.\nNonetheless, expecting people to abandon passwords in a market like India is hard due to its vast demographics and diverse economic landscape.\n“We knew for a very long time that passwords were not secure. This concept of a multi-factor authentication was a step forward,” said Adkins, adding that Indians likely favor SMS-based authentication over other MFA options.\nTopics\nReporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

OpenAI doesn’t want Microsoft to get Windsurf’s intellectual property — which could enhance the cloud provider’s own AI coding tool, GitHub Copilot — according to the report.\nWhile Microsoft was once a major accelerant to OpenAI’s growth, the companies’ relationship has grown tense.

Many suspect, without direct evidence, that the issues may have to do with the use of AI automation.\nReached for comment, Meta has so far not offered an on-record statement.\nAccording to a growing number of social media posts, including on sites like Reddit and X, Instagram users report that their accounts were banned even though they had not violated the company’s terms of service or other policies. In addition, when they submitted an appeal to have their account reviewed, some claimed they received no response.\nOthers pointed out that they have no other way to directly contact a member of Meta’s support team, leaving them at a loss for what to do next.\n“I’ve already submitted multiple appeals, uploaded my ID, and tried reaching out to Meta through all the official channels, but I’ve been completely ignored. It feels like I’m shouting into a void,”wroteone Reddit user (u/Dyrovicious) about having their personal Instagram account banned.\n(We should note that Meta offersVerified accountsubscriptions for creators and businesses that offer priority access to customer service.)\nThe Instagram Redditcommunity’stop posts are nearly entirely focused on the ban wave and have been for weeks. On X, users areflooding Instagram’s replieswith pleas for the company to do something about the account suspensions or, at the very least, acknowledge the problem publicly. A Change.orgpetitionabout the bans now has over 4,000 signatures.\nThe situation has gotten so tense that some are nowthreatening to file a class action lawsuitagainst Meta over the bans.\nOf course, large internet companies will inevitably encounter a certain number of false positives due to their reliance on automated moderation systems, which occasionally make mistakes. However, an excessive number of bans is something that’s become a more recent focus — and one where many immediately suspect AI may be at fault.\nFor instance, Pinterest earlier this year was facing a similar problem with mass bans, which saw users complaining that their actions and posts hadn’t violated the company’s policies. One group of users had alsothreatenedlegal action over the bans at the time. Pinterest in May finallyadmittedthat the mass bans were a mistake caused by an “internal error,” but wouldn’t pinpoint the exact cause. The company claimed that the error was not due to AI moderation, though.\nIn Instagram’s case, the issues aren’t just affecting personal use of the app but also people’s livelihoods, as businesses have been caught up in the mass bans.\n“This is my livelihood, my full-time job. I heavily rely on Instagram for leads,”wrote one Reddit user(u/Paigejust) about their suspension.\n“This ban has directly affected my business and all of the hard work and branding that I’ve spent countless hours pouring into my business, my gym, and my students,” a gym owner on Reddit (u/CourtShaw)shared.\nWithout access to internal company data, it’s hard from the outside to tell whether recent bans represent an uptick in the number of typical false positives or not. To date, Meta has not publicly acknowledged the issue.\nIn addition, some of the Instagram users affected have reported that they’re being falsely banned for serious offenses, including CSE (child sexual exploitation). Theypointed outthat this is a career and reputation-ruining accusation, leaving them highly concerned.\n\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

That’s changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company,Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures.\nThe product, which feelsstraight out of the movie “Clueless,”is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits.\nUsers upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet.\nThereare others playing aroundin the AI styling space,such as Wheringand Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Wang considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective.\n“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.”\nThe product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama’s stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta’s AI.\nOther investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris’ niece Meena; Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super modelsJasmine Tookesand Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra.\nWang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She’s a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms.\nYears ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss’ podcast “Kode With Klossy.”\n“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said.\nWang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said.\nAlta has alreadystruck a partnershipwith the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencerZita d’Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe.\nAlta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific.\nThe plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide.\n“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she’s assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team.

    "content": "牛津大學路透新聞研究所（Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism）最新發布的年度數位新聞報告揭示，全球新聞消費正經歷重大轉變，傳統媒體正遭受前所未有的挑戰。這份基於 48 個國家、近 10 萬人調查的權威報告，指出人工智慧聊天機器人和網路意見領袖正迅速改變人們獲取新聞的方式。\n報告顯示，在美國，2025年1月總統就職典禮後的調查發現，社交媒體和影像平台首次超越電視和新聞網站，成為民眾獲取新聞的主要來源。特別是在年輕族群中，此趨勢更加明顯，超過半數35歲以下美國人主要從社群平台獲取新聞，而全球18-24歲年輕人中有44%依賴這些平台。\n（Source：Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism，下同）\n同時，越來越多人開始使用AI聊天機器人獲取新聞。雖然目前整體比例僅為7%，但在25歲以下年輕人中已達15%。ChatGPT是最受歡迎的新聞AI工具，其次為Google的Gemini和Meta AI。大眾主要使用AI來摘要（27%）、翻譯（24%）和推薦（21%）文章，使新聞消費更加個人化。\n網路創作者也成為顯著影響力量。在美國，Podcast主持人喬·羅根（Joe Rogan）影響力驚人，有五分之一受訪者曾接觸其新聞評論。福斯新聞前主播塔克·卡爾森（Tucker Carlson）也有14%的觸及率。無論是右派如梅根·凱利（Megyn Kelly）和班·夏皮羅（Ben Shapiro），還是左派如大衛·帕克曼（David Pakman），這些創作者特別受到年輕男性和對主流媒體不信任者歡迎。\n然而，研究也指出相關疑慮。超過七成美國人擔心無法辨別線上資訊真偽，多數人認為AI可能使新聞變得不透明和不準確。此外，網路意見領袖和政治人物被視為假訊息的主要來源。\n面對這一轉變，部分媒體開始與AI開發商合作，如法新社允許Mistral使用其新聞檔案；也有媒體如紐約時報對AI公司提起訴訟。這種新聞消費習慣的演變不僅衝擊媒體財務狀況，也讓政治人物能繞過傳統媒體直接與民眾溝通，顯著改變了資訊傳播生態。\n（首圖來源：Unsplash）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "Mirai School of Technology Is Changing Engineering in India - Here's How Students Are Learning AI from Day One",
    "content": "BusinessWire India\n\nNew Delhi [India], June 16: In a world where artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry, traditional engineering education remains trapped in yesterday's paradigms. India's AI market alone is expected to reach $17 billion by 2027, growing at over 25% annually. Yet in most colleges, students are still waiting. Waiting to code. Waiting to build. Waiting for \"real\" learning to begin, usually in the final year.\n\nThat's where Mirai School of Technology (MSOT) comes in. Based in India, MSOT is building a completely new kind of B.Tech program - one where students start building AI projects from their first semester, guided by experts who've worked at top global companies.\n\n\"We're not just teaching AI - we're training the people who will shape its future,\" say the founding team: Arpit Sarda (ex-JP Morgan), Kartik Mathur, and Varun Kohli (the team behind Coding Blocks, which has trained over 250,000 coders).\"\n\nWhat Makes MOST Different?\n\nFrom the moment students step into Mirai School of Technology's classrooms, the experience feels different. No dull lectures, no outdated textbooks. Instead, students learn to build apps, design AI tools, and solve real problems - with support from mentors who have worked at companies like Google, Microsoft, and JP Morgan.\n\nClassrooms are equipped with Apple labs, personal MacBooks, robotics kits, and premium AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT Plus. Students also get access to MiraiVerse Labs, where they can simulate tech projects in a virtual world.\n\nA 4-Year Roadmap That's Built for the Future\n\nYear 1: Start Building Immediately\n\nStudents learn core coding languages - Python, JavaScript, and C++ - and build real-world projects like a Netflix-style recommendation engine or healthcare management apps. By the end of the year, they've already submitted entries to major tech contests like SIH and ICPC.\n\nYear 2: Step into AI\n\nNow the real AI work begins. Students explore machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. They build real-time tools like object detection systems (inspired by Tesla) and cloud dashboards like AWS CloudWatch. Many take part in global contests like Google Summer of Code.\n\nYear 3: Build Big, Think Bigger\n\nThis year is all about scale and specialization. Students work with Large Language Models (LLMs), generative AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain. A six-month paid internship lets them apply their skills in the real world.\n\nYear 4: Lead the Change\n\nIn the final year, students launch industry-ready platforms - e-commerce systems, AI-powered apps, and enterprise software using OpenCV, Azure, and more. Many build products that serve real businesses and communities.\n\nFor the Top 20%, A Place to Shine: Mirai School of Technology keeps its intake selective. Only the top 20% of applicants are admitted - those who show true curiosity, drive, and potential. This ensures that students learn with equally driven peers, just like they would in a real tech company.\n\nLife After MSOT: Jobs, Startups, and More\n\nWhat happens after four years?\n\nMirai School of Technology graduates don't just find jobs - they command them. With 100% placement support, over 20 career mentors, and training in resume building, interviews, and startup pitching, students are ready to lead in companies or start their own.\n\nWhether it's working in AI, fintech, healthcare, robotics, or launching a product of their own, MSOT alumni will be equipped with both the technical skills and entrepreneurial mindset to make a mark.\n\nIf you're ready to build the future, you can register for MSOT and join the next cohort. Admission timeline is 20th June 2025.\n\nWhy This Matters for India\n\nAccording to NASSCOM, India will need over 1 million AI professionals by 2026, but there's already a 51% gap between demand and supply. Traditional colleges aren't producing job-ready AI talent - but Mirai School of Technology is changing that.\n\nWith its hands-on learning, future-facing curriculum, and real-world exposure, MSOT is preparing India's next generation of AI leaders of today.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by BusinessWire India.
