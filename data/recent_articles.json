To work on a team led byformer Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wangand at a desk physically near Zuckerberg, Meta has reportedly offered employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMindcompensation packages worth upwards of $100 million.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed those reports on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman, which waspublished on Tuesday.However, the OpenAI CEO noted that Zuckerberg‚Äôs recruiting efforts have been largely unsuccessful and made sure to throw a few more digs at Meta in the process.\nNew episode of Uncapped with@sama. Enjoy ü§ópic.twitter.com/2IxYt3B4Gm\n‚Äú[Meta has] started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team,‚Äù Sam Altman said on the podcast. ‚ÄúYou know, like, $100 million signing bonuses, more than that [in] compensation per year [‚Ä¶] I‚Äôm really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.‚Äù\nThe OpenAI CEO said he believed his employees made the assessment that OpenAI had a better chance of achieving AGI and may one day be the more valuable company. He also said he believes Meta‚Äôs focus on high compensation packages for employees, rather than the mission of delivering AGI, would likely not create a great culture.\nMeta reportedly tried topoachone of OpenAI‚Äôs lead researchers, Noam Brown, as well as Google‚Äôs AI architect, Koray Kavukcuoglu. However, both efforts were unsuccessful.\nSam Altman went on to say he believes OpenAI‚Äôs culture of innovation has been a major key to its success, and that Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrent AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.‚Äù The OpenAI CEO said he respects many things about Meta but noted he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink they‚Äôre a company that‚Äôs great at innovation.‚Äù Later in the podcast, Altman said he believes it‚Äôs not enough for companies to catch up on AI ‚Äî they have to truly innovate to stay ahead.\nThe OpenAI CEO‚Äôs comments highlight some of the challenges that Meta has to overcome in order to build out a successful AI superintelligence lab. Besides bringing on Wang, Meta announced last week that itinvested significantlyin Wang‚Äôs former company, Scale AI. The company has also reportedlynabbed a few star AI researchers, such as Google DeepMind‚Äôs Jack Rae and Sesame AI‚Äôs Johan Schalkwyk. But there‚Äôs more work ahead.\nIn the coming year, Meta will have to staff up its new AI team while OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind operate at full speed. In the coming months, OpenAI is expected torelease an open AI modelthat‚Äôs likely to set Meta back in the AI race even further.\nLater on in the podcast, Sam Altman described an AI-powered social media feed that seems likely to encroach on Meta‚Äôs apps. The OpenAI CEO said he‚Äôs curious about exploring a social media app that uses AI to deliver custom feeds based on what users want, rather than the default, algorithmic feed that exists on traditional social media apps.\nOpenAI is reportedlyworking on a social networking appinternally. Meanwhile, Meta is experimenting with an AI-powered social network through its Meta AI app. However, it seems that some users are confused by the Meta AI app and have shared somehyperpersonal chats with the broader world.\nWhether AI-powered social networks take off remains to be seen. In the meantime, Zuckerberg and Sam Altman seem poised to butt heads over the AI talent race.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond‚Äîfounders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

It says, ‚ÄúUnder this award, the performer will develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.‚Äù\nWhether that reference to war-fighting applies to the weapons themselves or just other areas associated with wars, like paperwork, remains to be seen. OpenAI‚Äôs guidelines do forbid individual users to use ChatGPT or its APIs to develop or use weapons. However, OpenAI deleted the explicit prohibitions of ‚Äúmilitary and warfare‚Äù in its terms of service backin January 2024.\nGiven how heavily some powerful people in Silicon Valley have warned of the dangers of China‚Äôs advanced LLM models, it‚Äôs not surprising the DoD wants to use OpenAI for whatever purposes it wants. For instance, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, an OpenAI investor, recently appeared on Jack Altman‚Äôs ‚ÄúUncapped‚Äù podcast (Jack is Sam Altman‚Äôs brother). Andreessen described the race between China‚Äôs AI andthe Western world‚Äôs models as a ‚Äúcold war.‚Äù\nStill, perhaps an equally interesting part of this announcement is what it says about OpenAI‚Äôsincreasingly strained relationship with its major investor Microsoft.\nMicrosofthas thousands of contractswith the federal government worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It has, for decades, been implementing the strict security protocols necessary for the government ‚Äî especially the DoD ‚Äî to use its cloud.\nOpenAI announced this deal as part of its broader new ‚ÄúOpenAI for Government‚Äù program, which consolidates a number of other programs it uses to sell wares directly to government agencies, including the U.S. National Labs‚Å†, the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, NIH, and the Treasury, according to the company.\nBut it was only in April thatMicrosoft announcedthe DoD had approved its Azure OpenAI Service for all classified levels.

The problem has reduced the visibility of users‚Äô posts because many people on the platform have configured their settings to hide mature content by default.\nAccording to numerous posts from impacted Tumblr users, posts have been falsely flagged despite not being sexual or violent, and these false takedowns have included everything fromcat GIFs to fandom contenttoartand even apicture of hands. Some suspect that AI-based automation could be to blame for the issues.\nSimilar accusations have plagued other social media platforms in recent weeks. For instance, Pinterest finally admitted that an internal errorled to its mass user bans. Meanwhile, Instagram this week declined tocomment on its own trouble with mass bansthat users said have been given little coverage or attention outside of online complaints on apps like X and Reddit.\nIn both cases, users suspected that AI-based moderation was to blame, though Pinterest denied that was the case.\nOn Tumblr, the flagging issue is tied to an update to the Android app, where the company said it‚Äôs been experimenting with improvements to its mature content filtering systems. Specifically, it was testing out a new layer of moderation toContent Labels, the company told TechCrunch.\nA spokesperson for Tumblr said the experiments are continuing and, based on user feedback, will be improved before the changes roll out to other platforms.\n‚ÄúAs we work to make Tumblr a safer place for all users, we aim to respect a diverse set of interests and content preferences, which can be adjusted in settings. We view this as an ongoing process as we continue to fine-tune how we detect and address mature content,‚Äù a Tumblr spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company alsoacknowledged the problem on its blog, responding to a user‚Äôs question about the falsely flagged posts. Here, Tumblr‚Äôs team noted they were aware of the ‚Äúincorrect classification issues‚Äù and were actively working to reduce them.\nIn addition, the post explained that Tumblr‚Äôs appeal process was being updated in the weeks ahead to be able to handle a higher volume of cases. (Tumblr did not respond to our questions about the appeals process‚Äô planned changes.)\nWhether AI or other automation is to blame is not clear, as Tumblr wouldn‚Äôt speak specifically to the cause of the new issues. However, the reduced staffing at the blogging service has likely also played a role.\nFollowing its 2019acquisitionby WordPress.com maker Automattic,Tumblr has faced layoffsas its staff was reassigned toother projects at the parent company. Last year, Automattic announced that Tumblr‚Äôs back end would also bemoved to WordPressto make management easier and stemits financial losses.\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.\nAnysphere CEO Michael Truell said in the blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans ‚Äî ranging from$100 a monthto$250 a month‚Äî as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users and offer them increased usage.\nThe new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere‚Äôs already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor hadreached $500 million in annualized recurring revenueand is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe.\nAnysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down. Based onTechCrunch‚Äôs previous reporting, Cursor‚Äôs ARR has grown by $200 million since April.\nHowever, the race to develop ‚Äúvibe-coding‚Äù tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedlyacquired Cursor‚Äôs competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.\nIt‚Äôs unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We‚Äôve seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recentlyslashed Windsurf‚Äôs direct access to Claude AI modelsas a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.\nAt the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources toward developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out anew ‚ÄúTab‚Äù AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.\nIn a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere‚Äôs multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren‚Äôt going anywhere just yet.

    "content": "On June 15, Luo Yonghao‚Äôs digital avatar hosted its first livestream on Baidu‚Äôs e-commerce platform, attracting more than 13 million views and generating over 55 million yuan ($7.66 million) in gross merchandise value. Several 3C and food product categories reportedly surpassed the sales figures from Luo‚Äôs real-person debut in May, marking a new high for AI-driven livestreams. The session featured several technical firsts for the industry. It was the first time a top-tier Chinese influencer was represented by an AI-generated avatar for an entire livestream, which lasted more than six hours. The stream also introduced multi-avatar interaction, with Luo‚Äôs avatar and a co-host engaging in synchronized gestures and banter, mimicking real human behavior. According to Baidu, the AI system drew from a 13,000-item knowledge base and generated 97,000 words of product descriptions, coordinating more than 8,300 avatar movements during the session. Luo, founder of Smartisan Technology and Thin Red Line, began livestreaming sales on Douyin to pay off his debts. He continued until 2022, when he announced his exit from all social media to focus on Thin Red Line. [Technode report]",

    "content": "Munich-based defence tech startup Helsing has raised‚Ç¨600mn as geopolitical tensions trigger a flood of capital into AI warfare.\nThe large investment was led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek‚Äôs VC firm Prima Materia. Itbrings the company‚Äôs total raised to north of ‚Ç¨1.3bn,building on a‚Ç¨450mn funding round in Julylast year.\nHelsing didn‚Äôt disclose its updated valuation. However, according to theFinancial Times, the unicorn company is now worth ‚Ç¨12bn, making it one of Europe‚Äôs five most valuable private tech companies.\nPrima Materiawas one of Helsing‚Äôs earliest backers ‚Äî a move that sparkedboycottsamong artists on Spotify, who feared their use of the platform was helping to fund war.That backlash clearly hasn‚Äôt deterred Ek, though, who said Helsing‚Äôs technology ensures ‚Äústrategic autonomy‚Äù for Europe.\n‚ÄúBy doubling down on our investment, Prima Materia reaffirms its commitment to empowering Europe‚Äôs technological sovereignty ‚Äî an ambition Helsing perfectly embodies,‚Äù said Ek.\nFounded in 2021, Helsing has developed an autonomous strike drone now in use by several European militaries, including Ukraine‚Äôs. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomousreconnaissance submarines, and last week successfully used its self-driving system to pilot a Saab fighter jet.\nHelsing is riding a defence investment boom as war in Ukraine and rising security concerns push European governments to double down on military spending and explore AI technologies for warfare.\nAccording to a new reportfrom McKinsey,investment in European defence techstartupsrose by over 500% between 2021 and 2024 compared to the previous three years.\nWhile Helsing is currently Europe‚Äôs most valuable defence tech startup, many other companies are experiencing rising demand for their technologies.\nIn May,Germandual-use drone makerQuantum Systems raised ‚Ç¨160mn at a valuation north of ‚Ç¨1bn, shortly after Portuguese drone startup Tekever also reached the coveted unicorn status.\nARX Robotics, another Munich-based company, recently raised ‚Ç¨31mn to expand its fleet ofautonomous land drones, shortly after announcing itsplans to invest ¬£45mn into anew UK factory.\nKate Leaman, chief market analyst at online broker AvaTrade,previously told TNWthat military tech companies have ‚Äúhuge potential‚Äù for growth ‚Äî particularly those with AI-driven solutions.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,‚Äù Leaman said. ‚ÄúThis suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.‚Äù\nSi√¥n is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "title": "Facilitating Real-Time Transactions From Canada to the World: Z≈´m Rails Partners with Western Union",
    "content": "A recent survey conducted byInteracfound that nearly nine in 10 Canadians (88 per cent) have used Interac e-Transfer, a money-moving service inCanada. Canadians continue to rely on this product to move $338billion over the past 12 months, and over $625billion since the pandemic began, with 49 per cent indicating that they have increased their use in this period.\nHowever, moving money beyond Canada is challenging. This is where integrating Z≈´m Rails‚Äô APIs into Western Union‚Äôs network is helpful. This will in turn enable the company to drive real-time movement of funds for Western Union customers using Interac eTransfer. With Interac eTransfer, customers can instantly fund their money transfers in Canada, then send the money to anywhere in the world.\nWith the rise of real-time payments and other digital experiences, consumers have become accustomed to sending and receiving money in seconds. However, speed is dictated by the payments rails technology integrated into a financial institution‚Äôs network. While new options have emerged to facilitate transactions in real-time, building the technology to integrate these rails and supporting compliance protocols into their existing infrastructures requires significant time and resources.\n‚ÄúOur work with Western Union reflects a larger trend across the payments industry, defined by real-time money movement as a non-negotiable service for consumers and enterprises alike,‚Äù saidMiles Schwartz, CEO atZ≈´m Rails.\n‚ÄúPartnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintechs are proving to be a catalyst in accelerating this trend. Western Union is in a unique position to lead the industry forward, leveraging its technological innovation and its deep history in the cross-border remittance industry. We look forward to working with them to support their efforts in delivering an exceptional customer experience.‚Äù\n‚ÄúConsumers should be able to send payments anywhere in the world at the same speed as they can with native peer-to-peer applications. Our work with Z≈´m Rails makes this a reality,‚Äù saidRanjit Sarai,vice president of digital and ecosystem at Western Union in Canada. ‚ÄúThat is only part of what we have in store for Western Union customers as we work to bring a number of entirely new digital financial experiences to market, to complement the reliable service they‚Äôve come to expect.‚Äù\nThe Fintech Times",

    "title": "Leading a Unicorn: In Conversation With Haider Khan, CEO of Bayut and dubizzle",
    "content": "Haider Khanis the CEO of proptech companyBayut, as well asdubizzle, an online marketplace. He is also the head of UAE-based unicornDubizzle Group MENA.\nAside from leading one of the region‚Äôs few unicorns, Khan also boasts an impressive list of experience, having spent a short time atGoldman Sachs, before spending the next 14 years atNational InstrumentsandSilicon Laboratories.\nDuring this time, he worked on a wide range of large-scale projects, from working on 5G technology to sharing his expertise with theElon Musk-led space technology companySpaceX.\nThe technology leader eventually moved on to the UAE in 2014, where he has successfully scaled high-growth platforms, raised over $500million in funding, and led a landmark merger withOLXacross the UAE, Pakistan, Egypt, and Lebanon. Under his leadership, Dubizzle Group became a company valued at over $1billion.\nWe sat down with Khan to find out more about how he led Dubizzle Group to success, his engineering background, progress in the UAE, and his big plans for the future.\nReaching unicorn status was never the end goal ‚Äì it was a natural result of staying relentlessly focused on solving real consumer and business problems at scale. One of the most pivotal decisions we made early on was to double down on localisation. We didn‚Äôt just copy-paste global models ‚Äì we reimagined them for the unique nuances of the UAE.\nSecondly, we embraced tech as a core differentiator, not just a support function. By investing heavily in our AI and ML capabilities at a very early stage, launching problem-solving products like TruCheck, and then scaling that with proprietary tools like TruBroker, TruEstimate and ProConnect, and maintaining a laser focus on user trust and quality, we created platforms that are not only large in reach but deep in value.\nOur acquisition strategy has also played a critical role, bringing dubizzle into the fold and building a full-stack ecosystem across classifieds and proptech gave us the kind of operational and data synergy that few players can match.\nIt starts with listening. Every market has its own economic rhythms, user behaviours and trust barriers‚Äîso while the technology stack might be scalable, the go-to-market execution must be hyperlocal.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our local teams drive product-market fit with autonomy, but within the framework of a centralised innovation roadmap. That means we stay true to our mission‚Äîbuilding smarter ecosystems while giving our regional brands the freedom to innovate based on local feedback loops.\nOur unified vision acts as the North Star, but our strength lies in the adaptability of our routes to get there.\nMy engineering background taught me to break down complex problems and build solutions from the ground up. Whether it was working on 5G or at SpaceX, my mindset has always been the same: question everything, simplify where possible and focus on scalable outcomes that offer real value.\nThat approach has carried through into my work at Dubizzle Group. I always say this: I see technology as more than just a support tool. It‚Äôs a part of our DNA as an organisation, and it shapes how we solve problems for users, how we build trust and how we stay ahead.\nWe‚Äôve embedded this thinking into everything, from building AI tools like TruEstimate to introducing authentication features like TruCheck or agent recognition systems like TruBroker. It‚Äôs about using smart tech to create better experiences, not just faster ones.\nOne of the biggest advantages of the UAE is the constant thirst for exceeding expectations, a sentiment that I deeply resonate with. The UAE isn‚Äôt just participating in digital transformation ‚Äì it‚Äôs orchestrating it. What sets this region apart is its proactive policymaking and willingness to co-create with the private sector. Initiatives like the Dubai PropTech Hub and the Digital Economy Strategy reflect a bold vision to make this region a global tech powerhouse.\nFor tech companies, alignment means more than just regulatory compliance ‚Äì it‚Äôs about impact. We need to build with purpose: empowering SMEs, upskilling talent, and embedding sustainability and inclusion into our platforms.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our investments in AI, local talent, and ecosystem data transparency are all aligned with the UAE‚Äôs ambition to be not just digitally enabled, but digitally sovereign.\nThe next phase is about moving from platforms to ecosystems. We‚Äôre connecting the dots between discovery, transaction, and post-sale services to create seamless, trust-driven digital journeys, whether someone is buying a car, renting a home, or launching a business.\nAIis a big part of that future. Our ‚ÄòSell with AI‚Äô tool already allows users to list with intelligent suggestions in seconds. In under a month, we have had over 100,000 listings added to the platform with this smart assistant. Bayut‚Äôs industry-leading solutions, like TruBroker and TruEstimate are helping bring unmatched transparency and efficiency to previously fragmented markets.\nWe‚Äôre also doubling down on our data infrastructure, predictive analytics, user insights, market benchmarks ‚Äì so that every stakeholder, from agents to government bodies, can make faster, smarter decisions.\nUltimately, future-proofing means staying restless. We‚Äôre building for where the market is going, not just where it is today.\nThe Fintech Times",

    "title": "Big Seven Remain Go-to Place for New Banking Customers But Digital Banks on the Rise Reveals Curinos",
    "content": "Published in its2025 Great Britain Shopper Survey,Curinosuncovers that digital expectations, competitive switching offers and generational shifts in behaviour are reshaping loyalty in the retail banking landscape.\nKurt Vogt Gwerder, strategy consultant at Curinos, said:‚ÄúThe 2025 GB Shopper Surveyshows traditional banks still lead in customer acquisition. However, digital challengers are gaining influence. Customers are no longer staying with banks out of habit ‚Äì they‚Äôre switching for value.\n‚ÄúCash incentives still attract, but don‚Äôt guarantee satisfaction or loyalty. Digital challengers are building trust through better digital experiences and more relevant offerings, such as financial guidance. Promotions may draw people in, but only strong, engaging value propositions will keep them.‚Äù\nWhile the UK‚Äôs Big Seven banking providers remain the first stop for ‚Äònew-to-banking‚Äô customers (72 per cent), digital banks are making significant gains with more seasoned customers. In fact, 34 per cent of customers leaving a Big Seven bank switched to a digital challenger.\nNotably, 75 per cent of these switchers were moving for the first time since 2020, significantly above the market average of 62 per cent, highlighting a behavioural shift among long-term customers.\nAmong those switching from a Big Seven bank to a digital one, the top drivers of attrition were competitive offers (22 per cent) and dislike of their previous bank‚Äôs mobile app (18 per cent) and online banking (18 per cent).\nDigital banksnow acquire 59 per cent of their primary customers from switchers coming directly from the Big Seven. Despite this growing competition, the Big Seven banks continue to dominate, securing 61 per cent of primary current account openings over the past three years.\nThe majority of customers continue to prefer opening their account digitally (84 per cent), with smartphones (61 per cent) being the most preferred channel versus on a desktop (18 per cent) or via a tablet (five per cent).\nHowever, on average, 10 per cent of all recent account openers still prefer to set up their current account in person, with Boomers the generation most likely to prefer this option (23 per cent). Thirteen per cent of those new to banking are more likely to visit a branch to open an account, whilst 15 per cent of newcomers to the country are likely to do so. This demonstrates genuine demand for the service, suggesting branches remain a vital channel, particularly for interactions perceived as complex or stressful.\nFurthermore, the survey found that:\nThe Fintech Times",
