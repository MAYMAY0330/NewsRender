OpenAI doesn’t want Microsoft to get Windsurf’s intellectual property — which could enhance the cloud provider’s own AI coding tool, GitHub Copilot — according to the report.\nWhile Microsoft was once a major accelerant to OpenAI’s growth, the companies’ relationship has grown tense.

That’s changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company,Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures.\nThe product, which feelsstraight out of the movie “Clueless,”is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits.\nUsers upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet.\nThereare others playing aroundin the AI styling space,such as Wheringand Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Wang considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective.\n“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.”\nThe product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama’s stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta’s AI.\nOther investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris’ niece Meena; Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super modelsJasmine Tookesand Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra.\nWang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She’s a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms.\nYears ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss’ podcast “Kode With Klossy.”\n“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said.\nWang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said.\nAlta has alreadystruck a partnershipwith the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencerZita d’Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe.\nAlta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific.\nThe plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide.\n“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she’s assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team.

    "title": "Mirai School of Technology Is Changing Engineering in India - Here's How Students Are Learning AI from Day One",
    "content": "BusinessWire India\n\nNew Delhi [India], June 16: In a world where artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry, traditional engineering education remains trapped in yesterday's paradigms. India's AI market alone is expected to reach $17 billion by 2027, growing at over 25% annually. Yet in most colleges, students are still waiting. Waiting to code. Waiting to build. Waiting for \"real\" learning to begin, usually in the final year.\n\nThat's where Mirai School of Technology (MSOT) comes in. Based in India, MSOT is building a completely new kind of B.Tech program - one where students start building AI projects from their first semester, guided by experts who've worked at top global companies.\n\n\"We're not just teaching AI - we're training the people who will shape its future,\" say the founding team: Arpit Sarda (ex-JP Morgan), Kartik Mathur, and Varun Kohli (the team behind Coding Blocks, which has trained over 250,000 coders).\"\n\nWhat Makes MOST Different?\n\nFrom the moment students step into Mirai School of Technology's classrooms, the experience feels different. No dull lectures, no outdated textbooks. Instead, students learn to build apps, design AI tools, and solve real problems - with support from mentors who have worked at companies like Google, Microsoft, and JP Morgan.\n\nClassrooms are equipped with Apple labs, personal MacBooks, robotics kits, and premium AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT Plus. Students also get access to MiraiVerse Labs, where they can simulate tech projects in a virtual world.\n\nA 4-Year Roadmap That's Built for the Future\n\nYear 1: Start Building Immediately\n\nStudents learn core coding languages - Python, JavaScript, and C++ - and build real-world projects like a Netflix-style recommendation engine or healthcare management apps. By the end of the year, they've already submitted entries to major tech contests like SIH and ICPC.\n\nYear 2: Step into AI\n\nNow the real AI work begins. Students explore machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. They build real-time tools like object detection systems (inspired by Tesla) and cloud dashboards like AWS CloudWatch. Many take part in global contests like Google Summer of Code.\n\nYear 3: Build Big, Think Bigger\n\nThis year is all about scale and specialization. Students work with Large Language Models (LLMs), generative AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain. A six-month paid internship lets them apply their skills in the real world.\n\nYear 4: Lead the Change\n\nIn the final year, students launch industry-ready platforms - e-commerce systems, AI-powered apps, and enterprise software using OpenCV, Azure, and more. Many build products that serve real businesses and communities.\n\nFor the Top 20%, A Place to Shine: Mirai School of Technology keeps its intake selective. Only the top 20% of applicants are admitted - those who show true curiosity, drive, and potential. This ensures that students learn with equally driven peers, just like they would in a real tech company.\n\nLife After MSOT: Jobs, Startups, and More\n\nWhat happens after four years?\n\nMirai School of Technology graduates don't just find jobs - they command them. With 100% placement support, over 20 career mentors, and training in resume building, interviews, and startup pitching, students are ready to lead in companies or start their own.\n\nWhether it's working in AI, fintech, healthcare, robotics, or launching a product of their own, MSOT alumni will be equipped with both the technical skills and entrepreneurial mindset to make a mark.\n\nIf you're ready to build the future, you can register for MSOT and join the next cohort. Admission timeline is 20th June 2025.\n\nWhy This Matters for India\n\nAccording to NASSCOM, India will need over 1 million AI professionals by 2026, but there's already a 51% gap between demand and supply. Traditional colleges aren't producing job-ready AI talent - but Mirai School of Technology is changing that.\n\nWith its hands-on learning, future-facing curriculum, and real-world exposure, MSOT is preparing India's next generation of AI leaders of today.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by BusinessWire India.
