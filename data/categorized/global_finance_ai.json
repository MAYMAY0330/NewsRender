    "content": "A recent survey conducted byInteracfound that nearly nine in 10 Canadians (88 per cent) have used Interac e-Transfer, a money-moving service inCanada. Canadians continue to rely on this product to move $338billion over the past 12 months, and over $625billion since the pandemic began, with 49 per cent indicating that they have increased their use in this period.\nHowever, moving money beyond Canada is challenging. This is where integrating Zūm Rails’ APIs into Western Union’s network is helpful. This will in turn enable the company to drive real-time movement of funds for Western Union customers using Interac eTransfer. With Interac eTransfer, customers can instantly fund their money transfers in Canada, then send the money to anywhere in the world.\nWith the rise of real-time payments and other digital experiences, consumers have become accustomed to sending and receiving money in seconds. However, speed is dictated by the payments rails technology integrated into a financial institution’s network. While new options have emerged to facilitate transactions in real-time, building the technology to integrate these rails and supporting compliance protocols into their existing infrastructures requires significant time and resources.\n“Our work with Western Union reflects a larger trend across the payments industry, defined by real-time money movement as a non-negotiable service for consumers and enterprises alike,” saidMiles Schwartz, CEO atZūm Rails.\n“Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintechs are proving to be a catalyst in accelerating this trend. Western Union is in a unique position to lead the industry forward, leveraging its technological innovation and its deep history in the cross-border remittance industry. We look forward to working with them to support their efforts in delivering an exceptional customer experience.”\n“Consumers should be able to send payments anywhere in the world at the same speed as they can with native peer-to-peer applications. Our work with Zūm Rails makes this a reality,” saidRanjit Sarai,vice president of digital and ecosystem at Western Union in Canada. “That is only part of what we have in store for Western Union customers as we work to bring a number of entirely new digital financial experiences to market, to complement the reliable service they’ve come to expect.”\nThe Fintech Times",

    "title": "Big Seven Remain Go-to Place for New Banking Customers But Digital Banks on the Rise Reveals Curinos",
    "content": "Published in its2025 Great Britain Shopper Survey,Curinosuncovers that digital expectations, competitive switching offers and generational shifts in behaviour are reshaping loyalty in the retail banking landscape.\nKurt Vogt Gwerder, strategy consultant at Curinos, said:“The 2025 GB Shopper Surveyshows traditional banks still lead in customer acquisition. However, digital challengers are gaining influence. Customers are no longer staying with banks out of habit – they’re switching for value.\n“Cash incentives still attract, but don’t guarantee satisfaction or loyalty. Digital challengers are building trust through better digital experiences and more relevant offerings, such as financial guidance. Promotions may draw people in, but only strong, engaging value propositions will keep them.”\nWhile the UK’s Big Seven banking providers remain the first stop for ‘new-to-banking’ customers (72 per cent), digital banks are making significant gains with more seasoned customers. In fact, 34 per cent of customers leaving a Big Seven bank switched to a digital challenger.\nNotably, 75 per cent of these switchers were moving for the first time since 2020, significantly above the market average of 62 per cent, highlighting a behavioural shift among long-term customers.\nAmong those switching from a Big Seven bank to a digital one, the top drivers of attrition were competitive offers (22 per cent) and dislike of their previous bank’s mobile app (18 per cent) and online banking (18 per cent).\nDigital banksnow acquire 59 per cent of their primary customers from switchers coming directly from the Big Seven. Despite this growing competition, the Big Seven banks continue to dominate, securing 61 per cent of primary current account openings over the past three years.\nThe majority of customers continue to prefer opening their account digitally (84 per cent), with smartphones (61 per cent) being the most preferred channel versus on a desktop (18 per cent) or via a tablet (five per cent).\nHowever, on average, 10 per cent of all recent account openers still prefer to set up their current account in person, with Boomers the generation most likely to prefer this option (23 per cent). Thirteen per cent of those new to banking are more likely to visit a branch to open an account, whilst 15 per cent of newcomers to the country are likely to do so. This demonstrates genuine demand for the service, suggesting branches remain a vital channel, particularly for interactions perceived as complex or stressful.\nFurthermore, the survey found that:\nThe Fintech Times",
