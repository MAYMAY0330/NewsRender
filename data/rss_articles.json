    "content": "Latest\nAI\nAmazon\nApps\nBiotech & Health\nClimate\nCloud Computing\nCommerce\nCrypto\nEnterprise\nEVs\nFintech\nFundraising\nGadgets\nGaming\nGoogle\nGovernment & Policy\nHardware\nInstagram\nLayoffs\nMedia & Entertainment\nMeta\nMicrosoft\nPrivacy\nRobotics\nSecurity\nSocial\nSpace\nStartups\nTikTok\nTransportation\nVenture\nEvents\nStartup Battlefield\nStrictlyVC\nNewsletters\nPodcasts\nVideos\nPartner Content\nTechCrunch Brand Studio\nCrunchboard\nContact Us\nIt doesn’t look like much, but Finland recently flipped the switch on the world’s largest sand-based battery.\nYes, sand.\nA sand battery is a type of thermal energy storage system that uses sand or crushed rock to store heat. Electricity — typically from renewable sources — is used to heat the sand. That stored heat can later be used for various ends, including to warm buildings.\nThe economics are compelling, and it’s hard to get any cheaper than the crushed soapstone now housed inside an insulated silo in the small town of Pornainen. The soapstone was basically trash — discarded from a Finnish fireplace maker.\nThough it might not be as visually impressive as a large lithium-ion battery pack, the 2,000 metric tons of pulverized rock inside the 49-foot-wide silo promises to slash Pornainen’s carbon emissions, helping the town eliminate costly oil that currently helps power the town’s district heating network.\nLike many Scandinavian towns, Pornainen operates a central boiler that heats water for homes and buildings around town. Polar Night’s battery can store 1,000 megawatt-hours of heat for weeks at a time, enough for a week’s worth of heating in the chilly Finnish winter. From storage to recovery, only about 10% to 15% of the heat is lost, and the temperature at the outlet can be up to 400°C.\nThe town’s district heating system also relies on burning wood chips, and the sand battery will reduce that consumption by about 60%, according to Polar Night. Heat from the battery could also generate electricity, though the process would sacrifice some efficiency.\nAs renewables have gotten cheaper, interest in thermal batteries has grown. Beyond Polar Night, numerous startups are pursuing thermal batteries. Scotland-based Sunamp isbuilding onethat relies on the same material that gives salt-and-vinegar potato chips their flavor. Electrified Thermal Solutions, TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield 2023runner-up, has created a type of brick that canproduce heatapproaching 2,000°C. And Fourth Power is making graphite blocks thatstore electricityas 2,400°C heat.\nPornainen’s battery is charged using electricity from the grid, and its massive storage capacity allows the operator to draw power when it’s cheapest. Finland’s grid ismostly renewables(43%) and nuclear (26%), meaning its electricity is pretty clean. It’s also thecheapest in Europeat just under €0.08 per kilowatt-hour — less than half the EU average.\nPolar Night didn’t disclose the project’s cost, though the raw materials are cheap and the structure itself isn’t particularly complex. A much smaller prototype built a few years ago cost around$25 per kilowatt-hourof storage, the company estimated at the time. It’s likely the new version is cheaper. Lithium-ion batteries cost around$115 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

The move doesn’t come as a surprise, as the social network wasspotted developingthe feature as far back as 2022.\nSome users havereported seeingthe feature on their accounts, with onenoting that userswill be able to repost their own content in addition to other users’ posts.\nOf course, not everyone will be on board if Instagram decides to roll out the change officially, especially since it would add yet another content format to a platform already overcrowded with posts, Stories, Reels, Notes, DMs, ads, and more.\nOn the other hand, some people will welcome the change since it will allow them to share and amplify interesting content like they already do on other platforms.\nAlthough you can currently share someone’s post in your Story, this upcoming repost functionality will let you reshare the post in Instagram’s Feed. In addition, some people currently use workarounds and third-party apps to repost content, so an official reshare feature would get rid of the need to find alternatives.\nAs for creators, the repost functionality could be a way for them to boost their reach and discoverability. Plus, Instagram is flooded with reposted memes and photos that often don’t credit original posters, so the addition of a repost feature could help ensure that creators receive credit when their content is shared widely.\nIt makes sense for Instagram to introduce the ability to repost, especially since the format has been adopted by other social networks like Threads and TikTok. It’s worth noting that reposts were popularized by Twitter’s introduction ofthe “Retweet” featureback in 2009.\nAs with any other test feature, it’s unknown when or if Instagram plans to release its repost functionality to all users.\n\nTopics\nConsumer News Reporter\nAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The company said on June 13 it will collaborate with Chinese state-owned automaker FAW and Dragon Rise New Energy Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed energy infrastructure provider, to push the adoption of the technology in Hong Kong. As part of the move, a number of right-hand-drive versions of FAW’s E-QM5 electric sedan under its Hongqi or Red Flag marque, known to be former state leader Chairman Mao Zedong’s favorite car brand, will incorporate CATL’s swappable EV batteries and be distributed in the city. CATL in December announced plans to build 1,000 battery swap stations in China in 2025. A joint venture between CATL and Orange Energy, the energy unit of ride-hailing platform Didi, will render development and operative support for the battery swap online platform.

    "content": "與台灣住房都是由本國人自己炒高的不一樣，西班牙人將住房危機歸咎外國人，包括每年9千萬國際遊客、遠距工作，還有來自世界各地的國際學生，以及看準房產市場的外國投機客，這些外來人不只造成住房短缺，也推高西班牙房價，當地抗議者批評這是外國人的「猖獗投機」。\n去年，西班牙的國際遊客人數激增10.1%，達到9,380萬人次，創歷史新高，使西班牙成為全球第二大旅遊目的地國，僅次於法國。\n▲去年西班牙夏季旅遊人次更勝疫情前。(Source：Trading Economics)\n由於需求高，價格好，房仲賣房亂象叢生，連不符合居住標準，在房產登記冊上被列為儲藏空間，現在也被房產經紀人推銷成可做出租使用，租給遊客，或是在西班牙求學的國際學生。一家西班牙房地產新創公司，甚至讓買家買房中房，就是只買一戶住房中的一個房間，可以出租。這種現象都反應一個需求遠大於供給的市場。\n去年西班牙房地產市場經歷強勁增長，房屋銷量大幅增長，房價也隨之飆升，去年第四季，住宅平均價格為暪平方公尺 1,972 歐元，幾乎已追上2007年房地產繁榮時期以及2008年泡沫破裂時的水平。根據美國投資公司MD Capital數據，2014年平均售價13.8萬歐元的房屋，到2024年升值至17.87萬歐元。有些度假勝地房價漲一倍以上，但過去十年西班牙平均薪資只成長23%多一點，而同期房地產價格卻上漲至少29%。\n外媒分析，推動西班牙城市房價高漲的動力，與十年前廉價信貸推高西班牙房價不同，今天主要是由財力雄厚的外國投資者推動。當地居民也起推波助瀾的作用。根據西班牙國家統計局的數據，西班牙有超過250萬套住房只是偶爾使用，其中許多被認為是第二或第三套住房，通常用於度假，很少出租給他人。\n由於需求高，租金也不斷上漲，2024年西班牙人的平均月薪為2,642歐元，約9萬台幣。房地產入口網站Fotocasa的數據顯示，一套普通的80平方公尺公寓，約24坪面積大小，目前的月租金約為1,100歐元，約3.7萬台幣，而馬德里或巴塞隆納等大城市類似公寓的租金則在1,400歐元至1,500歐元之間，超過5萬台幣。\n如今，在西班牙買房子比以往任何時候都貴，然而與居住在巴黎或倫敦等城市的人們不同，西班牙居民不會獲得工資補貼來抵消更高的住房成本，因此當地人不只要承擔飛漲的房租，由於越來越多的房屋被出租給前往西班牙的國際遊客和學生，可能有錢也租不到房。\n西班牙政府正在著手一項新的立法，試圖對非歐盟買家的購屋徵收100%的稅，同時，西班牙正式終止「黃金簽證」計畫，該計畫允許富裕的外國人透過購買高價房產獲得居留權，通常 50 萬歐元即可過門檻。\n但這些手段來得不夠快，實際成效也未知，每到夏季旅遊旺季，當地人就得承受生活不易的壓力。然而，疫後旅遊很快就會熄火，專家警告稱，當地居民抵制、更嚴格的監管，以及旅遊市場的日益成熟，可能會抑制近年來強勁的上升趨勢，加上全球受經濟不確定性降低消費意願，西班牙旅遊業兩位數的成長，不太可能持續下去。\n(首圖來源：Unsplash)\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "Artificial solar eclipse engineered in Europe offers new look at Sun",
    "content": "Two satellites equipped with European tech have delicately pulled off an artificial solar eclipse — giving scientists unmatched views of the Sun’s scorching corona.\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) developed the probes alongside more than 40 space tech firms. Among them are a trio of startups, which contributed several key technologies for the mission: sensors for solar tracking, light detectors to fine-tune positioning, and software that orchestrated the satellites’ intricate flight path.\nLaunched from India’sSatish Dhawan Space Centrelast year, the expedition — Proba-3 — could mark a new era for solar science.\nThe pair of satellites orbits the Earth in formation, 150 metres apart. One of them,Occulter, acts as the Moon would in a solar eclipse down on Earth. It blocks the Sun, allowing its counterpart satellite, the Coronagraph, to view the Sun’s outer atmosphere or “corona” without being blinded by the intense light.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nThe Sun’s corona is the outermost part of its atmosphere. Surprisingly, it’s far hotter than our star’s surface, sometimes reaching up to 2 million °C. This tumultuous region of superheated, radiative gases is the source of solar storms and coronal mass ejections, which can disrupt telecommunications on Earth — and producebreathtaking Northern Lightsdisplays.\nThe corona is typically only visible to the naked eye during a total solar eclipse, giving scientists only a brief window to study it. But Proba-3’s achievement could change that.\n“We can create our eclipse once every 19.6-hour orbit, while total solar eclipses only occur naturally around once, very rarely twice a year,” explained Andrei Zhukov of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, which developed the Coronagraph’s main optical sensing instrument ASPIICS.\nWhile natural total eclipses only last a few minutes, Proba-3 can maintain its artificial eclipse for up to 6 hours. Both satellites can remain perfectly aligned with each other andthe Sun to within millimetre precision — all while racing around Earth at a speed of 1 kilometre per second.\nThat precision relies on the combined innovations of several European companies. Dutch startup Lens R&D, a graduate of ESA’s business incubator, provided sensors that continuously track the Sun’s position to within fractions of a degree, enabling the delicate choreography of formation flying.\nMeanwhile, engineers at Irish firm Onsemi (formerly SensL) added highly sensitive light detectors called silicon photomultipliers, which measure tiny shifts in the Sun’s shadow across the satellite’s structure to fine-tune their positioning during the eclipse.\nSupporting this hardware is software from Poland’s N7 Mobile, a startup that pivoted from consumer apps to computer systems that control spacecraft. Its code contributes to the probe’s formation control systems.\nAll these technologies are part of a European effort to make a six-hour eclipse in orbit not only possible, but repeatable.\nSiôn is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "title": "Opinion: Space startups are pivoting to defence. That’s great for innovation",
    "content": "Afew months ago, atthe SmallSat Symposium, a panel issued a sobering warning to space startups: do not chase defence dollars at the expense of long-term sustainability. Why? Because companies, particularly in the space sector, might be tempted to follow the money rather than focus on producing valuable products and services with broader, longer-term applications. It’s of course true thatanycompany should be wary of “leaning in” too closely to what seem like passing fads. But the warning overlooks an important reality: the shift towards defence investing is not a trend. It’s a transformation in space and space investment, and one that will have positive — albeit unintended — consequences.\nAcross the space sector, there has been a noticeable shift towards focusing on pure defence investing. Companies that once prioritised commercial applications, or at most maintained dual-use business models, are now making full-scale pivots to defence. Needless to say, that move isn’t random. It’s the product of geopolitical changes, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and a widespread belief that the world is changing. As Michael Gove, who served in the Cabinets of four British prime ministers,put it recently: “The ideal of a rules-based international order, where multilateral institutions restrain states pursuing their self-interest, has proved to be a false hope… we are back to a world closer to that ofThucydidesin which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”\nThe change is happening at the public sector level, too. In 2024, global governmental expenditure onspaceprogrammes surged to $135 billion (€119 billion) — up 10% from the year before. The primary driver was rising defence budgets. Arecent Bruegel reportconcluded that without support from the United States, “Europe could need 300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion” to keep the continent safe. As geopolitical tensions rise, governments worldwide have been funnelling money into space-based defence technology, a recognition that the sector is the cornerstone of any modern military.\nOne of the unintended yet highly beneficial consequences of this shift amongstartupsis its impact on the private space sector. Increased defence investment is breathing new life into aerospace and deep-tech innovation. Companies that previously struggled to secure commercial funding are now benefiting from sustained government investment, allowing them to work on cutting-edge technologies. These include (among many others) optical communications, needed for secure and high-speed space-based data transmission; Earth observation, crucial for climate monitoring, disaster response, and resource management; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), enabling all-weather, day-and-night imaging capabilities with high precision.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nDespite the opportunities that await here, moving from purely commercial to defence markets is not without its hurdles. Startups can face significant challenges. Government contracts often come withdelayed payments and long procurement cycles, creating cashflow issues for smaller firms that lack financial reserves. Defence-related technologies are subject to stringent export controls and compliance requirements, heaping bureaucratic burdens on startups that many are ill-equipped to bear.\nBut for those companies that make the pivot successfully, the rewards far outweigh these obstacles. Defence funding provides long-term stability and a runway for companies to develop world-class technology that may later be commercialised in other sectors. In other words, to pivot into space isn’t necessarily to leave behind the commercial world.\nSome startups are making full-blown pivots to defence, but the real sweet spot remains in the world of dual-use technology — those innovations that serve both commercial and defence markets. Companies that maintain this balance benefit from diverse revenue streams, greater resilience to market fluctuations, and the ability to shift emphasis as commercial demand evolves.\nThe success of this dual-use approach is plain to see in the companies that have seamlessly integrated their offerings across sectors. Take the SAR satellite company ICEYE, whose data is used in flood response, maritime activity monitoring, andconflict zones like Ukraine. Or FibreCoat, whose advanced materials protect satellites from the harsh conditions of space, regardless of what those satellites are used for.\nGiven the scale of government investment, as well as the ongoing volatility in the broader geopolitical landscape, it’s highly unlikely that the present shift in focus towards defence is merely a fad. There is anew world orderin place, and national security considerations will play a defining role in geopolitics for years to come.\nHowever, the space sector’s ultimate goal should be a balanced ecosystem where defence and commercial efforts reinforce one another. The current surge in defence spending is helping accelerate technological innovation, funding infrastructure that will benefit the commercial sector in the long run. As companies continue to develop dual-use applications, they can ensure that the innovations sparked by defence priorities also drive broader commercial progress.\nThat’s good news because space touches almost every area of modern life. It’s the backbone of the world economy. It plays a vital role in navigation, communication, connectivity, and sustainability. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion (€1.58 trillion) by 2035, accordingto a reportby McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. We may well be entering anew golden agefor the industry, one in which entrepreneurs have access to more capital, investors are more willing to back high-risk ventures, and technology development is progressing at an unprecedented pace.\nIf companies can navigate the challenges of defence contracting while remaining mindful of the broader commercial applications of their products, the entire space ecosystem stands to benefit. For startups, the key will be balancing short-term defence opportunities with long-term strategic growth, so ensuring that today’s pivot does not become tomorrow’s dead end. But if the evolution towards greater defence investing is managed wisely by all involved parties, it could propel the space industry into its most vibrant era yet.\nDefence tech will be a hot topic atTNW Conference, which takes place inAmsterdam on June 19-20.Tickets for the event arenow on sale— use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the checkout to get 30% off.\nBogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stag(show all)Bogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stage companies working in the space technology sector.

    "content": "Qubits, entanglement, superposition, trapped ions, Schrödinger’s cat. These termssoundstrange because the world of quantum mechanics — where things can exist in multiple states at once —isstrange.\nThankfully, a group of students from TU Delft are bringing these powerful sub-atomic phenomena to life atTNW Conferencethrough an exhibition of abstract artworks.\nTheir project, Emergence Delft, blends science and creativity into a mind-bending exploration of quantum reality. A centrepiece of the exhibition is Coexist — a mesmerising light installation that captures the elusive nature of quantum mechanics through colour, interaction, and design.\nAt its heart, Coexist tackles superposition, the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states at once. For instance, a qubit — thequantumversion of a classical bit — can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. But it doesn’t stay that way forever. The moment it’s observed, the qubit collapses into a single, definitive state — a phenomenon known as the act of measurement.\nInside Coexist, a glowing white light — which contains all visible colours — symbolises superposition. Around it, oversized polarisation filters are arranged like futuristic portholes. As visitors peer through and rotate these filters, different colours are revealed, depending on how the filters interact with the light waves. Just like in quantum mechanics, the act of looking changes what you perceive.\nStill don’t get it? Don’t worry, we don’t either. That’s why we’ll be heading to the exhibition onthe business floorofTNW Conferenceon June 19-20 to uncover the quantum mystery.

    "title": "Instagram’s New Features: Spotify Integration To Notes And Customizable Grid",
    "content": "Instagramhas introducedSpotify music integration into Notes, allowing users to share the songs they’re currently listening to in real time. Announced on Thursday (June 12), this update enhances the temporary status feature located in the Stories section by syncing directly with Spotify, updating as the music changes. This integration builds upon last year’s “Add to Spotify” button and provides a more dynamic, real-time connection between the two platforms.\nThe update echoes nostalgic features from older messaging platforms like MSN, where users could display what they were listening to. Until now, music could only be added manually to Notes; the new feature automates the process, improving the experience and making it more expressive. Instagram explained that this change is part of its broader“Anyway” campaign, which aims to reduce pressure on users andencourage creativity and spontaneous sharing.\nUsers will be able to tap the green bubble above profile icons in Notes to view the full song title and artist name. (Image: Meta)\nAnother key feature coming soon is theability to manually rearrange posts on a user’s profile grid. Starting next week, users will be able to reposition content in any order, moving beyond the current reverse-chronological layout. This feature grants more control over how one’s profile is presented, especially beneficial for creators and brands.\nThe customizable grids will be very welcomed by many Instagram users (Image: Meta)\nAdditionally, Instagram is expanding access to areels testing featurethat lets creators preview how their videos perform with new audiences before sharing them publicly. Previously limited in availability, this tool reportedly led to a 40% increase in posting frequency among early adopters, according to the platform.\nThese changes align with Instagram’s ongoing effort to support users inmanaging the pressure and anxiety of posting online, which the “Anyway” campaign directly addresses. While more features aimed at easing this experience are in development, further details will be revealed in the future.\nFinally, Meta confirmed that anative Instagram app for iPad is in development—a long-requested addition, especially given that Android tablets already have dedicated support. This move could enhance the user experience for Apple tablet users and is part of broader efforts to modernize the platform across devices.\nFiled inCellphones.
