    "title": "Opinion: Space startups are pivoting to defence. That’s great for innovation",
    "content": "Afew months ago, atthe SmallSat Symposium, a panel issued a sobering warning to space startups: do not chase defence dollars at the expense of long-term sustainability. Why? Because companies, particularly in the space sector, might be tempted to follow the money rather than focus on producing valuable products and services with broader, longer-term applications. It’s of course true thatanycompany should be wary of “leaning in” too closely to what seem like passing fads. But the warning overlooks an important reality: the shift towards defence investing is not a trend. It’s a transformation in space and space investment, and one that will have positive — albeit unintended — consequences.\nAcross the space sector, there has been a noticeable shift towards focusing on pure defence investing. Companies that once prioritised commercial applications, or at most maintained dual-use business models, are now making full-scale pivots to defence. Needless to say, that move isn’t random. It’s the product of geopolitical changes, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and a widespread belief that the world is changing. As Michael Gove, who served in the Cabinets of four British prime ministers,put it recently: “The ideal of a rules-based international order, where multilateral institutions restrain states pursuing their self-interest, has proved to be a false hope… we are back to a world closer to that ofThucydidesin which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”\nThe change is happening at the public sector level, too. In 2024, global governmental expenditure onspaceprogrammes surged to $135 billion (€119 billion) — up 10% from the year before. The primary driver was rising defence budgets. Arecent Bruegel reportconcluded that without support from the United States, “Europe could need 300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion” to keep the continent safe. As geopolitical tensions rise, governments worldwide have been funnelling money into space-based defence technology, a recognition that the sector is the cornerstone of any modern military.\nOne of the unintended yet highly beneficial consequences of this shift amongstartupsis its impact on the private space sector. Increased defence investment is breathing new life into aerospace and deep-tech innovation. Companies that previously struggled to secure commercial funding are now benefiting from sustained government investment, allowing them to work on cutting-edge technologies. These include (among many others) optical communications, needed for secure and high-speed space-based data transmission; Earth observation, crucial for climate monitoring, disaster response, and resource management; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), enabling all-weather, day-and-night imaging capabilities with high precision.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nDespite the opportunities that await here, moving from purely commercial to defence markets is not without its hurdles. Startups can face significant challenges. Government contracts often come withdelayed payments and long procurement cycles, creating cashflow issues for smaller firms that lack financial reserves. Defence-related technologies are subject to stringent export controls and compliance requirements, heaping bureaucratic burdens on startups that many are ill-equipped to bear.\nBut for those companies that make the pivot successfully, the rewards far outweigh these obstacles. Defence funding provides long-term stability and a runway for companies to develop world-class technology that may later be commercialised in other sectors. In other words, to pivot into space isn’t necessarily to leave behind the commercial world.\nSome startups are making full-blown pivots to defence, but the real sweet spot remains in the world of dual-use technology — those innovations that serve both commercial and defence markets. Companies that maintain this balance benefit from diverse revenue streams, greater resilience to market fluctuations, and the ability to shift emphasis as commercial demand evolves.\nThe success of this dual-use approach is plain to see in the companies that have seamlessly integrated their offerings across sectors. Take the SAR satellite company ICEYE, whose data is used in flood response, maritime activity monitoring, andconflict zones like Ukraine. Or FibreCoat, whose advanced materials protect satellites from the harsh conditions of space, regardless of what those satellites are used for.\nGiven the scale of government investment, as well as the ongoing volatility in the broader geopolitical landscape, it’s highly unlikely that the present shift in focus towards defence is merely a fad. There is anew world orderin place, and national security considerations will play a defining role in geopolitics for years to come.\nHowever, the space sector’s ultimate goal should be a balanced ecosystem where defence and commercial efforts reinforce one another. The current surge in defence spending is helping accelerate technological innovation, funding infrastructure that will benefit the commercial sector in the long run. As companies continue to develop dual-use applications, they can ensure that the innovations sparked by defence priorities also drive broader commercial progress.\nThat’s good news because space touches almost every area of modern life. It’s the backbone of the world economy. It plays a vital role in navigation, communication, connectivity, and sustainability. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion (€1.58 trillion) by 2035, accordingto a reportby McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. We may well be entering anew golden agefor the industry, one in which entrepreneurs have access to more capital, investors are more willing to back high-risk ventures, and technology development is progressing at an unprecedented pace.\nIf companies can navigate the challenges of defence contracting while remaining mindful of the broader commercial applications of their products, the entire space ecosystem stands to benefit. For startups, the key will be balancing short-term defence opportunities with long-term strategic growth, so ensuring that today’s pivot does not become tomorrow’s dead end. But if the evolution towards greater defence investing is managed wisely by all involved parties, it could propel the space industry into its most vibrant era yet.\nDefence tech will be a hot topic atTNW Conference, which takes place inAmsterdam on June 19-20.Tickets for the event arenow on sale— use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the checkout to get 30% off.\nBogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stag(show all)Bogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stage companies working in the space technology sector.

When one person in a pair receives a match, a group chat begins with all four participants. Users also have the option to like an individual profile within the match if they prefer to chat one-on-one. Users can invite up to three friends to join in this new dating experience.\nBy encouraging users to double date with friends, this approach aims to reduce the pressure and anxiety often associated with solo dating, creating a more comfortable environment for everyone involved.\n“In early testing, users consistently told us they felt more comfortable to be their authentic selves when connecting as a pair with a friend, which often led to stronger engagement,”  Cleo Long, head of product marketing, told TechCrunch. “The group chat format helps break the ice and makes it easier to plan casual meetups, whether those evolve into friendships, romantic connections, or something in between.”\nThe launch of this new feature follows Tinder’s parent company,Match Group, reporting a 5% decline in paying subscribers, which fell to 14.2 million in the first quarter across its dating apps.\nDouble Date may be an effort to regain these users while also attracting new ones. According to the company, early testing results were promising, with nearly 12% of users who accepted a Double Date invite being either new or returning users.\nAdditional internal data shows that individual users participating in Double Date chats sent 25% more messages than in typical one-on-one conversations. Message volume in these group chats was found to be 35% higher, especially among users under 29.\nThe Double Date feature was tested in select markets, including parts of Latin America, Spain, and the Nordics. A global rollout of the feature is set for July.\nThere has been a growing interest in group-oriented dating experiences, with similar apps likeFourplay,DuoDate, andDoubblehaving success in this niche. Notably, areport from UK-based dating app Slide 1828 found that 48% of Gen Z respondents believe that double dates could alleviate dating anxiety.\nIn addition to Double Date, Long pointed to other features, such asMatchmakerandShare My Date, as similar options that help “turn dating into more of a team sport,” she told us. Long noted that a recent Tinder report found that nearly half of singles seek support from friends when navigating the dating scene.\nThe feature also seems to build upon past concepts, including the earlierTinder Social, but focuses more on creating a serious yet comfortable dating experience rather than a party atmosphere.\nTopics\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Electricity — typically from renewable sources — is used to heat the sand. That stored heat can later be used for various ends, including to warm buildings.\nThe economics are compelling, and it’s hard to get any cheaper than the crushed soapstone now housed inside an insulated silo in the small town of Pornainen. The soapstone was basically trash — discarded from a Finnish fireplace maker.\nThough it might not be as visually impressive as a large lithium-ion battery pack, the 2,000 metric tons of pulverized rock inside the 49-foot-wide silo promises to slash Pornainen’s carbon emissions, helping the town eliminate costly oil that currently helps power the town’s district heating network.\nLike many Scandinavian towns, Pornainen operates a central boiler that heats water for homes and buildings around town. Polar Night’s battery can store 1,000 megawatt-hours of heat for weeks at a time, enough for a week’s worth of heating in the chilly Finnish winter. From storage to recovery, only about 10% to 15% of the heat is lost, and the temperature at the outlet can be up to 400°C.\nThe town’s district heating system also relies on burning wood chips, and the sand battery will reduce that consumption by about 60%, according to Polar Night. Heat from the battery could also generate electricity, though the process would sacrifice some efficiency.\nAs renewables have gotten cheaper, interest in thermal batteries has grown. Beyond Polar Night, numerous startups are pursuing thermal batteries. Scotland-based Sunamp isbuilding onethat relies on the same material that gives salt-and-vinegar potato chips their flavor. Electrified Thermal Solutions, TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield 2023runner-up, has created a type of brick that canproduce heatapproaching 2,000°C. And Fourth Power is making graphite blocks thatstore electricityas 2,400°C heat.\nPornainen’s battery is charged using electricity from the grid, and its massive storage capacity allows the operator to draw power when it’s cheapest. Finland’s grid ismostly renewables(43%) and nuclear (26%), meaning its electricity is pretty clean. It’s also thecheapest in Europeat just under €0.08 per kilowatt-hour — less than half the EU average.\nPolar Night didn’t disclose the project’s cost, though the raw materials are cheap and the structure itself isn’t particularly complex. A much smaller prototype built a few years ago cost around$25 per kilowatt-hourof storage, the company estimated at the time. It’s likely the new version is cheaper. Lithium-ion batteries cost around$115 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

    "title": "Artificial solar eclipse engineered in Europe offers new look at Sun",
    "content": "Two satellites equipped with European tech have delicately pulled off an artificial solar eclipse — giving scientists unmatched views of the Sun’s scorching corona.\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) developed the probes alongside more than 40 space tech firms. Among them are a trio of startups, which contributed several key technologies for the mission: sensors for solar tracking, light detectors to fine-tune positioning, and software that orchestrated the satellites’ intricate flight path.\nLaunched from India’sSatish Dhawan Space Centrelast year, the expedition — Proba-3 — could mark a new era for solar science.\nThe pair of satellites orbits the Earth in formation, 150 metres apart. One of them,Occulter, acts as the Moon would in a solar eclipse down on Earth. It blocks the Sun, allowing its counterpart satellite, the Coronagraph, to view the Sun’s outer atmosphere or “corona” without being blinded by the intense light.\nThe Sun’s corona is the outermost part of its atmosphere. Surprisingly, it’s far hotter than our star’s surface, sometimes reaching up to 2 million °C. This tumultuous region of superheated, radiative gases is the source of solar storms and coronal mass ejections, which can disrupt telecommunications on Earth — and producebreathtaking Northern Lightsdisplays.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nThe corona is typically only visible to the naked eye during a total solar eclipse, giving scientists only a brief window to study it. But Proba-3’s achievement could change that.\n“We can create our eclipse once every 19.6-hour orbit, while total solar eclipses only occur naturally around once, very rarely twice a year,” explained Andrei Zhukov of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, which developed the Coronagraph’s main optical sensing instrument ASPIICS.\nWhile natural total eclipses only last a few minutes, Proba-3 can maintain its artificial eclipse for up to 6 hours. Both satellites can remain perfectly aligned with each other andthe Sun to within millimetre precision — all while racing around Earth at a speed of 1 kilometre per second.\nThat precision relies on the combined innovations of several European companies. Dutch startup Lens R&D, a graduate of ESA’s business incubator, provided sensors that continuously track the Sun’s position to within fractions of a degree, enabling the delicate choreography of formation flying.\nMeanwhile, engineers at Irish firm Onsemi (formerly SensL) added highly sensitive light detectors called silicon photomultipliers, which measure tiny shifts in the Sun’s shadow across the satellite’s structure to fine-tune their positioning during the eclipse.\nSupporting this hardware is software from Poland’s N7 Mobile, a startup that pivoted from consumer apps to computer systems that control spacecraft. Its code contributes to the probe’s formation control systems.\nAll these technologies are part of a European effort to make a six-hour eclipse in orbit not only possible, but repeatable.\nSiôn is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "content": "\n日経の記事利用サービスについて\n企業での記事共有や会議資料への転載・複製、注文印刷などをご希望の方は、リンク先をご覧ください。\n【カナナスキス（カナダ西部）=三木理恵子】石破茂首相は16日（日本時間17日午前）、カナダでトランプ米大統領と30分間会談した。米政権が日本に課した関税措置を見直すよう求めた。会談後、記者団に「双方の認識が一致していない点が残っている。パッケージ全体の合意には至っていない」と述べた。\nトランプ氏から明確な回答は得られず、関税の扱いについて協議を続けることとなった。自動車関税などで課題が残っているとみられる。\n首相は日米双方の担当閣僚に対し、さらに協議を進めるよう指示をすることで一致したと語った。「これまで日米双方が本当に真摯な議論を精力的に続けた。ギリギリまで交渉の可能性を探ってきている」と説明した。\n目標とする合意の時期については「いつまでにということを申し上げるのは困難だ」と答えた。自動車を例に挙げ「国益を守り抜くために、我々として最善の努力を重ねる」と話した。率直な意見交換だったと振り返った。\nトランプ氏はスターマー英首相との首脳会談の際に、記者団から関税交渉を巡り「日本とはどうだったか」と問われ「よかった」と発言した。\n石破首相は会談のなかで米国への投資を拡大する方針などを伝え、日米双方が利益を得る関係が重要だと働きかけた。日本企業の米国内での生産拡大など米経済への貢献を提示したもようだ。\n日本が世界最大の対米投資国であることや、現地で雇用を創出していることを訴えたものの、トランプ氏からは自動車などの関税引き下げの言質を得られなかった。\n両首脳はカナダ西部のカナナスキスで始まった主要7カ国首脳会議（G7サミット）にあわせて会った。首相が2月にワシントンを訪れて以来、2度目となる対面会談で関税交渉に関する一定の合意を探った。\n日本側は4月に米国との閣僚間の関税協議が立ち上がった時点から、G7サミットの首脳会談を一つの節目と捉えてきた。\n日本は現在、米国から自動車・部品に25%、鉄鋼・アルミニウムに50%の追加関税をかけられている。これに加えて相互関税として各国・地域一律の10%と、上乗せ分の14%の計24%が課される。相互関税の上乗せ分は7月9日に発動期限を迎える。\nこれまで6回開いた日米の閣僚協議では目立った進展が見られず、首脳会談で現状の打開を狙った。\n日本政府は米国が関税政策の「最大の標的」とする中国への対応でも協力を提起してきた。\n米政権が自国の課題として認識しているレアアース（希土類）や半導体のサプライチェーン（供給網）で連携する用意がある。米国が非関税障壁と主張する日本国内の米国車の安全審査の方法なども再考する。\n【関連記事】\n※掲載される投稿は投稿者個人の見解であり、日本経済新聞社の見解ではありません。\n\nこの投稿は現在非表示に設定されています\nすべての記事が読み放題有料会員が初回１カ月無料\n日経の記事利用サービスについて\n企業での記事共有や会議資料への転載・複製、注文印刷などをご希望の方は、リンク先をご覧ください。\n石破茂首相とトランプ米大統領の首脳会談に関連する最新のニュースと解説をまとめました。\nトピックをフォローすると、新着情報のチェックやまとめ読みがしやすくなります。\nこちらもおすすめ(自動検索)\n関連キーワード",

    "content": "據調研機構 Counterpoint Research 最新《全球智慧型手機每月銷售報告》初步數據，iPhone 於 2025 年第二季前兩個月（4 月與 5 月）的全球銷量年增 15%，創下歷年同期新高，市占率亦為疫情後同期最高。\n\n（Source：Counterpoint Research）\n美國與中國，做為蘋果手機兩大關鍵市場，在本次統計期間雙雙轉為正成長，打破過去三年在此非旺季時期的下滑趨勢。特別是在中國市場，蘋果於 5 月重返市占第一的位置，顯示其在經歷與華為等品牌激烈競爭後，逐漸回穩並展現反彈力道。\nCounterpoint Research 資深分析師 Ivan Lam 指出，雖然 iPhone 在 2025 年第二季表現目前看起來穩健，但如同以往，一切仍取決於美國與中國市場的走勢。Counterpoint Research 正在觀察兩個趨勢：近期美國是否因關稅疑慮而提前購機？以及中國政府補貼政策與促銷優惠是否仍有助於推升 iPhone 需求？\nIvan 補充，這兩項趨勢的確正面影響了蘋果全球 iPhone 銷售表現。\n（Source：Counterpoint Research）\n除了中國和美國之外，日本、印度與中東高階市場亦貢獻亮眼的雙位數年成長表現。其中日本市場對 iPhone 的需求明顯回升，展現強勁動能。\nCounterpoint Research 日本分析師 Yoko Miyashita 表示，日本消費者對新推出的 iPhone 16e 反應熱烈，該機型延續過去 iPhone SE 等小尺寸機種的受歡迎程度，以親民的價格搭載 Apple Intelligence、簡約設計風格，正好貼合日本用戶偏好。Counterpoint Research 也觀察到 iPhone 16 基本款與舊款 iPhone 14 銷售同樣強勁，特別是在電信商促銷推動下，帶動明顯成長。\n印度則持續成為蘋果布局全球的重要市場，不僅是製造中心，同時也是成長潛力龐大的終端市場。Counterpoint Research 研究副總裁 Neil Shah 指出，對印度科技使用者而言，iPhone 是最具渴望的科技產品。隨著愈來愈多成熟的智慧型手機用戶開始升級，iOS 生態系持續吸引新用戶加入。目前 iPhone 在印度銷量的快速成長令人印象深刻，但長遠來看，蘋果的配件與服務才是持續推升成長的關鍵。\n針對近期 AI 熱潮對於換機潮的影響，Counterpoint Research 研究總監 Jeff Fieldhack 分析，尤其是中國市場對 iPhone 的需求上升，顯示對多數智慧型手機消費者而言，Agentic AI 尚未成為購機決策的關鍵因素，對於有意升級 iPhone 的用戶更是如此。\n綜合本週 WWDC 釋出的資訊與整體市場脈絡來看，Jeff 認為蘋果已成功爭取到更多時間，為未來 Siri 的重大升級與突破性體驗做好充分準備。\n（首圖來源：蘋果）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "content": "近來以伊戰爭、川普關稅政策疑慮齊發，多數已開發市場的股市卻未受到太大影響，仍在歷史高附近徘徊。分析人士認為，這意味著投資人堅信伊朗軍事能力不足以反擊以色列，難以撼動全球原油市場，而美國總統川普（Donald Trump）也總是臨陣退縮（Trump Always Chickens Out，簡稱 TACO）。\nMarketWatch 16日報導，Sevens Report創辦人Tom Essaye指出，伊朗軍事力量已然降級，反擊以色列飛彈攻擊、對抗以軍的能力嚴重受限。不只如此，由於長期遭到制裁的關係，伊朗不再是原油出口大國，而美國則已成為原油淨出口國，情勢跟1970年代的石油危機截然不同。沙烏地阿拉伯也有充裕的閒置產能，能在原油供給遭嚴重干擾時立刻遞補上來。\n在川普關稅戰方面，雖然關稅問題可能傷害全球經濟活動、拖累美國經濟成長並大幅推升通膨，但投資人目前並無驚慌失措的跡象。Essaye表示，除了投資人已對關稅消息感到疲勞、且一般人難以掌握各種關稅訊息和精確期限外，市場如今深信川普的最後通牒都只是虛張聲勢，這也讓TACO一詞開始流行。\n川普對等關稅的暫停期即將於7月9日截止，屆時市場可能會重新評估目前的冷淡態度。然而，Essaye認為，眼下市場對TACO深信不疑，關稅得不斷提升、才有可能動搖投資人信念。\nCNBC報導，德意志銀行分析師Jim Reid 16日則發表研究報告指出，以色列及伊朗雖相互報復，卻有意識地避開「最極端的升溫行動」。他指出，從過去歷史來看，標準普爾500指數通常會在地緣事件爆發後的三週期間拉回約6%，但之後三週就會一路回升、收復失土。\nReid表示，德銀策略師團隊相信，除非緊張情勢顯著升溫，否則本次以伊衝突造成的影響應該會比過往溫和，因為人們早已減碼對股市的資金配置。「標普500若要跌到6%，指數勢必得觸及其歷史波動區間的下緣」。\n（本文由MoneyDJ新聞授權轉載；首圖來源：Unsplash）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",
