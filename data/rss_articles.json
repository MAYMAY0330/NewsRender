Fraud related to the Indian government’s instant payment system UPIgrew 85% year-over-yearto nearly 11 billion Indian rupees ($127 million) last year, per the government’s data. India also saw several instances of digital arrest scams, where fraudsters pose as officials to extort money via video calls and predatory loan apps.\nWith its Safety Charter, Google aims to address some of these areas. The company has also launched itssecurity engineering centerin India, its fourth center after Dublin, Munich, and Malaga.\nAnnounced at the Google for India summit last year, the security engineering center (GSec) will allow Google to partner with the local community, including government, academia and students, and small and medium enterprises to create solutions to solve cybersecurity, privacy, safety, and AI problems, said Google VP of security engineering Heather Adkins in an interview with TechCrunch.\nGoogle has partnered with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to raise awareness of cybercrimes, the company said in a blog post. This builds upon the company’s existing work, including the launch of its online fraud identification program,DigiKavach, which debuted in 2023 to restrict the harmful effects of malicious financial apps and predatory loan apps.\nWith its GSec in India, Google will focus on three key areas, Adkins told TechCrunch: the phenomenon of online scams and fraud and how people are safe online; the cybersecurity of enterprises, government, and critical infrastructure; and building responsible AI.\n“These three areas will become part of our safety charter for India, and over the coming years… we want to use the fact that we have engineering capability here to solve for what’s happening in India, close to where the users are,” said Adkins.\nGlobally, Google is utilizing AI to combat online scams and remove millions of ads and ad accounts. The company aims to deploy AI more extensively in India to combat digital fraud.\nGoogle Messages, which comes preinstalled on many Android devices, uses AI-powered Scam Detection that has helped protect users from over 500 million suspicious messages a month. Similarly, Googlepiloted its Play Protectin India last year, which it claims has blocked nearly 60 million attempts to install high-risk apps, resulting in the stopping of more than 220,000 unique apps on over 13 million devices. Google Pay, which isone of the top UPI-based payment appsin the country, also displayed 41 million warnings against transactions suspected to be potential scams.\n—\nAdkins, a founding member of Google’s security team who has been part of the internet company for over 23 years, discussed several other topics during an interview with TechCrunch:\nAdkins said one thing top of mind is the use and misuse of AI by malicious actors.\n“We’re obviously tracking AI very closely, and up until now, we’ve mostly seen the large language models like Gemini used as productivity enhancements. For example, to make phishing scams a bit more effective — especially if the actor and the target have different languages — they can use the benefit of translation to make the scams more believable using deepfakes, images, video, etc.,” said Adkins.\nAdkins said Google is conducting extensive testing of its AI models to ensure they understand what they should not do.\n“This is important for generated content that might be harmful, but also actions that it might take,” said Akins.\nGoogle is working on frameworks, including theSecure AI Framework, to restrict the abuse of its Gemini models. However, to protect generative AI from being misused and abused by hackers in the future, the company sees the need for a framework to build safety for how multiple agents communicate.\n“The industry is moving very, very quickly [by] putting protocols out. It’s almost like the early days of the internet, where everybody’s releasing code in real time, and we’re thinking about safety after the fact,” said Adkins.\nGoogle does not want to introduce merely its own frameworks to limit the scope of generative AI being abused by hackers. Instead, Adkins said the company is working with the research community and developers.\n“One of the things you don’t want to do is constrain yourself too much in the early research days,” said Adkins.\nAlongside generative AI’s potential for abuse by hackers, Adkins sees commercial surveillance vendors as a significant threat. These can include spyware makers, includingNSO Group, which isinfamous for its Pegasus spyware, or other small enterprises selling surveillance tools.\n“These are companies spun up all over the world, and they develop and make and sell a platform for hacking,” said Adkins. “You might pay $20, you might pay $200,000, just depending on the sophistication of the platform, and it allows you to scale attacking people without any expertise on your own.”\nSome of these vendors also sell their tools tospy on people in markets, including India. However, apart from being targeted by surveillance tools, the country has its own unique challenges in part for its size. The country sees not only AI-led deepfakes and voice cloning frauds, but also instances ofdigital arrests, which Adkins underlines are just regular scams adapted for the digital world.\n“You can see how quickly the threat actors themselves are advancing… I love studying cyber in this region because of that. It’s often a hint of what we’re going to see worldwide at some point,” said Adkins.\nGoogle has long encouraged its users to use more secure authentication methods beyond passwords to protect their online presence. The company switched on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts in the past, and also promotes hardware-based security keys, which Adkins mentioned by pointing to its employees actively using their laptops. Passwordless is alsobecoming a popular tech term, with various meanings.\nNonetheless, expecting people to abandon passwords in a market like India is hard due to its vast demographics and diverse economic landscape.\n“We knew for a very long time that passwords were not secure. This concept of a multi-factor authentication was a step forward,” said Adkins, adding that Indians likely favor SMS-based authentication over other MFA options.\nTopics\nReporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

OpenAI doesn’t want Microsoft to get Windsurf’s intellectual property — which could enhance the cloud provider’s own AI coding tool, GitHub Copilot — according to the report.\nWhile Microsoft was once a major accelerant to OpenAI’s growth, the companies’ relationship has grown tense.

Many suspect, without direct evidence, that the issues may have to do with the use of AI automation.\nReached for comment, Meta has so far not offered an on-record statement.\nAccording to a growing number of social media posts, including on sites like Reddit and X, Instagram users report that their accounts were banned even though they had not violated the company’s terms of service or other policies. In addition, when they submitted an appeal to have their account reviewed, some claimed they received no response.\nOthers pointed out that they have no other way to directly contact a member of Meta’s support team, leaving them at a loss for what to do next.\n“I’ve already submitted multiple appeals, uploaded my ID, and tried reaching out to Meta through all the official channels, but I’ve been completely ignored. It feels like I’m shouting into a void,”wroteone Reddit user (u/Dyrovicious) about having their personal Instagram account banned.\n(We should note that Meta offersVerified accountsubscriptions for creators and businesses that offer priority access to customer service.)\nThe Instagram Redditcommunity’stop posts are nearly entirely focused on the ban wave and have been for weeks. On X, users areflooding Instagram’s replieswith pleas for the company to do something about the account suspensions or, at the very least, acknowledge the problem publicly. A Change.orgpetitionabout the bans now has over 4,000 signatures.\nThe situation has gotten so tense that some are nowthreatening to file a class action lawsuitagainst Meta over the bans.\nOf course, large internet companies will inevitably encounter a certain number of false positives due to their reliance on automated moderation systems, which occasionally make mistakes. However, an excessive number of bans is something that’s become a more recent focus — and one where many immediately suspect AI may be at fault.\nFor instance, Pinterest earlier this year was facing a similar problem with mass bans, which saw users complaining that their actions and posts hadn’t violated the company’s policies. One group of users had alsothreatenedlegal action over the bans at the time. Pinterest in May finallyadmittedthat the mass bans were a mistake caused by an “internal error,” but wouldn’t pinpoint the exact cause. The company claimed that the error was not due to AI moderation, though.\nIn Instagram’s case, the issues aren’t just affecting personal use of the app but also people’s livelihoods, as businesses have been caught up in the mass bans.\n“This is my livelihood, my full-time job. I heavily rely on Instagram for leads,”wrote one Reddit user(u/Paigejust) about their suspension.\n“This ban has directly affected my business and all of the hard work and branding that I’ve spent countless hours pouring into my business, my gym, and my students,” a gym owner on Reddit (u/CourtShaw)shared.\nWithout access to internal company data, it’s hard from the outside to tell whether recent bans represent an uptick in the number of typical false positives or not. To date, Meta has not publicly acknowledged the issue.\nIn addition, some of the Instagram users affected have reported that they’re being falsely banned for serious offenses, including CSE (child sexual exploitation). Theypointed outthat this is a career and reputation-ruining accusation, leaving them highly concerned.\n\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

That’s changed, so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company,Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures.\nThe product, which feelsstraight out of the movie “Clueless,”is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits.\nUsers upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet.\nThereare others playing aroundin the AI styling space,such as Wheringand Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Wang considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective.\n“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.”\nThe product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama’s stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta’s AI.\nOther investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris’ niece Meena; Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology fund; and a slew of angel investors including DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super modelsJasmine Tookesand Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra.\nWang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She’s a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms.\nYears ago, for example, she was an intern at DoorDash, and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss’ podcast “Kode With Klossy.”\n“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said.\nWang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said.\nAlta has alreadystruck a partnershipwith the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencerZita d’Hautville, are helping the company expand throughout Europe.\nAlta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific.\nThe plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide.\n“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she’s assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team.

    "content": "Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai has revealed that the company’s engineers worked through the Chinese New Year holiday to accelerate AI development after the company felt pressured by DeepSeek’s breakthrough. Speaking at the VivaTech conference in Paris, Tsai said DeepSeek’s low-cost, high-performance AI model which launched in January shocked the industry and exposed Alibaba’s lag in the field. “We read the research papers and we said, ‘Holy cow, how come we have fallen behind? We were doing the same things,’” Tsai said. “What happened was our engineering lead decided and said, ‘Cancel your Chinese New Year holiday, everybody stay in the company, sleep in the office, we’re going to accelerate our development.’” Within weeks, Alibaba released its Qwen series models. The sudden, intense push from one of China’s biggest tech companies reflects the impact of DeepSeek’s development as well as Alibaba’s strategic pivot toward AI after a two-year restructuring focused on e-commerce and cloud computing. Tsai emphasized that making Qwen open source is aimed at popularizing AI use and boosting demand for cloud services. Alibaba plans to invest over $53 billion in AI infrastructure over three years and has partnered with Apple to provide AI technology for iPhones. Despite these efforts, Tsai acknowledged ongoing challenges, with Alibaba’s revenue growing just 7% in Q1 2024. [Bloomburg,SCMP]",

    "title": "AI 教父 Geoffrey Hinton：白領工作恐遭 AI 取代，藍領反而較安全",
    "content": "在人工智慧（AI）迅速發展的背景下，對於神經網路領域的貢獻而被譽為「 AI 教父」的傑佛瑞·辛頓（Geoffrey Hinton）近日在《 CEO 日記》podcast 中分享了他對未來職場的看法。他指出，「白領工作」，如文書處理。將會有更高的可能性被 AI 取代。辛頓表示，隨著技術的進步，AI 最終將在各個領域超越人類，但在此之前，藍領工作因為需要「專業知識」以及以「體力」為主，相對安全。\n辛頓提到，成為水管工現在是一個不錯的選擇，因為AI在物理操作方面的能力仍然有限。他指出，對於那些在艱難的就業市場中掙扎的Z世代來說，越來越多的人選擇藍領工作。\n他強調，AI將取代例如律師助理和客服中心的工作，這些工作大多的技術門檻不高。辛頓認為，未來的工作將需要「非常高的專業技能」，才能抵禦被AI取代。\n儘管有些人認為對AI取代初階工作被過度誇大，辛頓認同某些職位將由人類與AI助理共同完成，但這意味著一個人將承擔原本十個人完成的工作，這將導致許多行業的大規模裁員。\n不過，辛頓也指出，像醫療保健因為需求極高，所以不會面臨被取代的風險，但他認為大多數工作並不具備這樣的彈性。\n（首圖內容：Flickr/Collision ConfCC BY 2.0）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "無人機廠商 Airo 受惠戰爭題材  掛牌兩天瘋漲 210%",
    "content": "Airo 為美國軍事無人機製造商，6 月 13 日在那斯達克交易所掛牌，交易代號「AIRO.US」。Airo 上市首日表現搶眼，股價漲幅高達 140%，第二日再飆漲近 30%，掛牌兩天來暴漲 210%，明顯受惠新一波無人機商機熱潮。\nMarketWatch等外媒報導，隨著地緣政治緊張局勢攀升，無人機成為各國加強戰力部署的重要武器，讓Airo吸引大量資金目光。Airo首日股價大噴發，早盤以每股12.90美元開出，較承銷價10美元高出29%，終場收在24美元，首日即飆漲140%。\nAiro 16日延續上攻氣勢，盤中最高衝上37.925美元，收在31美元，單日漲幅高達29.17%。\n復興資本（Renaissance Capital）分析師Matthew Kennedy指出，先前烏克蘭出動大批無人機攻擊俄軍告捷，讓無人機市場備受投資人關注，加上近期中東地緣風險提升，一旦戰事擴大，也可能進一步推動無人機需求，Airo受惠戰爭題材，是股價獲得追捧的原因。\n今年6月初，美國總統川普簽署行政命令，力促美國發展本土無人機產業，要求聯邦機關優先採購美製無人機，並積極擴大美製無人機出口，藉此強化美國無人機技術主導權。\n不過據財報顯示，Airo目前仍處於虧損狀態，第一季淨損197萬美元、營收1,180萬美元，而去年同期為淨損201萬美元、營收1,374萬美元。\n（本文由MoneyDJ新聞授權轉載；首圖來源：Airo）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "content": "Qubits, entanglement, superposition, trapped ions, Schrödinger’s cat. These termssoundstrange because the world of quantum mechanics — where things can exist in multiple states at once —isstrange.\nThankfully, a group of students from TU Delft are bringing these powerful sub-atomic phenomena to life atTNW Conferencethrough an exhibition of abstract artworks.\nTheir project, Emergence Delft, blends science and creativity into a mind-bending exploration of quantum reality. A centrepiece of the exhibition is Coexist — a mesmerising light installation that captures the elusive nature of quantum mechanics through colour, interaction, and design.\nAt its heart, Coexist tackles superposition, the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states at once. For instance, a qubit — thequantumversion of a classical bit — can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. But it doesn’t stay that way forever. The moment it’s observed, the qubit collapses into a single, definitive state — a phenomenon known as the act of measurement.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nInside Coexist, a glowing white light — which contains all visible colours — symbolises superposition. Around it, oversized polarisation filters are arranged like futuristic portholes. As visitors peer through and rotate these filters, different colours are revealed, depending on how the filters interact with the light waves. Just like in quantum mechanics, the act of looking changes what you perceive.\nStill don’t get it? Don’t worry, we don’t either. That’s why we’ll be heading to the exhibition onthe business floorofTNW Conferenceon June 19-20 to uncover the quantum mystery. It’s one of many weird and wild activities on the sidelines of the event.\nThe quantum art exhibition is just the start — TNW Conference is packed with epic side events to fuel your fun. Test your sporting prowess at our padel court, try out a mixed reality game calledMultiball, or belt out hits at the KPMG Karaoke Trailer. And don’t missDataSnipper’sGenAI photo booth, where you can transform into an AI-generated fantasy character in seconds.\nTalking of photography,while you’re exploring the event, networking, and engaging, don’t forget to capture the moments in theTNW Photo Challenge.\nSimply choose three to five of our photo challenges, snap your shots, and share them on social media using the right tags.

    "content": "This week on TNW Backstage, we’re heading into the fast lane — and straight into the climate debate.\nIn the final episode of the podcast, we revisit a divisive bet on sustainable motorsport: Extreme E, the all-electric racing series.\nThe events sent SUVs hurtling through some of the planet’s most fragile ecosystems. Supporters said they raised awareness about environmental issues, while detractors called it a classic case of greenwashing.\nAt last year’s TNW Conference, we were guided through the twists and turns by Ali Russell, then the managing director of Extreme E. In his talk, Russell laid out his vision for fighting climate change through high-octane racing. He pitched it as both a testing ground forEVinnovation and a global platform for environmental advocacy.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nThe results? Mixed. While Extreme E broke new ground in EV performance and gender equity, critics poured scorn on its sustainability claims.\nAtTNW Conference 2025,we’ll continue unpacking the tension between sustainability and innovation — especially in the future of mobility. Here’s a sample of what’s onthe agenda:\nAs for Extreme E, the series has now rebranded as Extreme H — the first hydrogen-powered off-road racing championship. Want to hear what led to the pivot? Then listen to TNW Backstageon Spotify, on ourdedicated podcast site, or via the media player at the bottom of this article.\nWe created TNW Backstage to take you behind the scenes of TNW Conference — and the tech shaping our world.

    "title": "Starmer tells UK to ‘push past’ AI job fears as tech leaders raise alarm",
    "content": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said it is time to “push past” concerns thatAIposes a threat to human jobs — contradicting the concerns of some of tech’s biggest players.\nSpeaking at London Tech Week today, Starmer called for industry to embed AI throughout the UK economy, from healthcare to education.\nBy taking on administrative tasks, Starmer argues that artificial intelligence tools can free up people to focus on the “human work.” For this reason, he said, “AI will make us more human.”\nStarmer’s assertion that AI is not here to replace humans, but to relieve them, is a popular sentiment among AI evangelists, including Microsoft’sSatya NadellaandJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nBy taking over the grunt work — such as filling out forms, summarising emails, or analysing spreadsheets — they argue that AI will enable people to do more meaningful work.\nHowever, not all tech leaders are so optimistic. Sebastian  Siemiatkowski, CEO of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, recently cautioned that rapid AI deployment may trigger a recession by decimating white‑collar jobs.\nSpeaking onThe Times Tech Podcast, Siemiatkowski claimed AI bots had already enabled the buy now, pay later firm to slash its workforce from 5,500 to 3,000 and replace 700 customer service roles.\n“There will be an implication for white‑collar jobs and when that happens that usually leads to at least a recession in the short term,” he said. He also criticised tech leaders for “downplaying the consequences of AI on jobs,” urging urgent societal preparation.\nDario  Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, painted an even starker picture in an interview with CNN last month. He warned that AI could wipe out “half of all entry‑level white‑collar jobs” within five years, potentially pushing unemployment in the US to 20%.\nAI has already been linked to job losses in many professions, including translation, customer service, copywriting, paralegal work, data entry, graphic design, and journalism. In an ironic twist of fate, the tech is alsothreateningthe jobs of the developers who helped create it.Entry-level jobsthat graduates rely on to kickstart their careers look to be the most at risk.\nWhile Starmer’s vision that AI will make us more human by shouldering mundane tasks paints a hopeful future, current trends paint a more complex picture. The warnings from Siemiatkowski, Amodei, andmany otherssuggest that, without urgent preparation and governance, we’re sleepwalking into economic uncertainty.\nAI’s future will be a hot topic atTNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

    "title": "Google Begins Testing AI-Powered Search Live On Android And iOS",
    "content": "Google has initiated testing ofSearch Live, a new AI-driven voice search feature, onAndroid and iOSdevices. Announced during the Google I/O event in late May, this experimental feature is part of a broader push to integrateconversational artificial intelligenceacross Google’s products. It complements the rollout ofGoogle AI Ultra, enhancements toGemini 2.5, and deeper integration withAndroid XR.\nSearch Live enables users to interact with Google’s search engine throughnatural voice conversations, transforming the traditional search experience into a more dynamic and hands-free interaction. The feature is currently being rolled out to alimited group of test users, who will see a new icon below the search bar — sound waves accompanied by a star, the same symbol used forGemini Live, signaling AI-enhanced functionality.\nUsers can also activate Search Live by clicking a circular icon next to the text input area ofAI Mode. At this stage, Search Live replaces theGoogle Lens shortcutthat previously allowed users to search using images from their gallery.\nGoogle Search Live enables natural voice-based AI searches (Image:9to5Google)\nTheuser interfacefor Search Live is minimalist and intuitive. It includes the Google “G” logo in the top left, a colorful curved sound wave in the center indicating active AI interaction, and control buttons formuting the microphone,transcribing the conversation, viewingadditional options, orexiting the tool. The interface adapts to the device’s theme, offering both light and dark modes.\nDespite being in its early stages, Search Live ismostly stable. However, some limitations exist. For instance, the transcription button currently redirects users to the AI Mode chat interface instead of displayingreal-time subtitles, andcamera features are not yet supported. On the plus side, users can choose fromfour different voice assistants—Cosmo, Neso, Terra, and Cassini—for a personalized experience.\nThere isno confirmed timelinefor a full public release, but Google is steadily refining the tool. Search Live allows users toask questions verbally, addcontextual follow-ups, and receiveinteractive, card-style search results, which can even be read aloud.\nTo try Search Live ahead of its wider release, users can enroll inSearch Labs, although early access is limited to those selected for the testing phase by Google.\nFiled inCellphones>Robots>Tablets.

    "title": "WhatsApp Now Allows Users Forwarding Media To Meta AI For Analysis",
    "content": "WhatsApp is introducing a new feature that allows users to forwardphotos, videos, and texttoMeta AI, the platform’s integrated chatbot, for content analysis. Initiallyreleasedthrough thebeta channel (version 2.25.18.8 for Android), the feature is also gradually rolling out to some stable users.\nWith this new capability, Meta AI can analyze forwarded content to providecontextual information, such as identifying thelocation where a photo was taken,describing images,cross-referencing data, and evenverifying the authenticity of viral videos. This function aims to enhance the chatbot’s utility, especially for users seeking quick insights about media content.\nAccording to WhatsApp, the feature has potentialanti-misinformation benefits. By enabling users to verify forwarded content using Meta AI, the tool could become avaluable asset in combating fake news and misinformation, particularly in viral media shared across chats.\nIn terms ofprivacy, Meta AI only accesses contentexplicitly shared by the user. All shared data isend-to-end encryptedduring transmission and isdeleted from cloud serversafter processing. This approach is designed to maintain user trust and uphold WhatsApp’s strong privacy standards.\nTo use the feature, users canselect a photo or video, tap thesharebutton, and check ifMeta AIappears as a sharing option. If it does, the content can be forwarded directly to the chatbot for analysis and feedback.\nThis enhancement follows another recent update to WhatsApp, which introducednew animationsfor sending media, further improving the overall user experience. Additionally, WhatsApp is also testing anew method to copy message content, indicating the company’s broader effort to refine user interactions and expand the app’s functionality.\nThese updates reflect Meta’s ongoing push to integrate AI-driven tools across its platforms, with WhatsApp now becoming a more intelligent and interactive messaging environment. As AI integration deepens, more features like this are likely to emerge, giving users enhanced ways to understand and manage shared content.\nFiled inCellphones>Robots.

    "title": "Microsoft Launches AI-Powered Bing Video Creator To Compete With Google’s Veo 3",
    "content": "Microsoft has announced the launch of theBing Video Creator, a new tool thatuses artificial intelligence to generate short videos from text prompts. This release is seen as a direct response toGoogle’s recent unveiling of Veo 3with Flow at the AI25 event. Integrated into the Bing app for Android and iOS, the feature ispowered by Microsoft’s Sora AIand allows users tocreate videos for free.\nTo use the tool, users simply need to open the Bing app, tap on the “All” tab, and select “Video Creator.” From there, they can describe the scene they want to generate, including elements like setting, motion, and visual details. Once submitted, the AI begins generating the video, and users are notified when it’s ready—allowing them to multitask within the app in the meantime.\nThe Bing Video Creator supports videos up to five seconds long in both 9:16 (vertical) and 16:9 (horizontal) formats. Users can generate up to three videos at a time and choose between Standard or Fast creation speeds. Microsoft provides 10 fast-generation credits as a demo, and additional fast creations can be unlocked using Microsoft Rewards points.\nCreative prompts such as “a small otter working as a chef in a busy Italian pizzeria” or “a knight in armor riding his horse through an autumn forest” demonstrate the tool’s flexibility in supporting a wide range of visual styles and imaginative ideas.\nAll generated videos are stored in the Bing Video Creator for up to 90 days, during which users can download them, share on social media, or send via email. Importantly, each video includes C2PA credentials, clearly identifying it as AI-generated content—an effort aimed at promoting transparency and curbing misinformation.\nWith this release, Microsoft expands its footprint in the AI-generated media space and positions itself in direct competition with Google’s offerings. The Bing Video Creator not only enhances the Bing ecosystem but also aims to make AI-assisted video creation more accessible through a user-friendly experience and incentive-based usage model.\nFiled inCellphones>Computers>Robots.

    "title": "GMail Introduces AI Summaries By Default On Android And iOS",
    "content": "Googlehas begun rolling outautomatic AI-generated email summaries in the GMail app for Android and iOS. This update representsa shift from Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, being an optional feature to becoming a standard tool for certain users. The aim is to provide a quicker overview of long or multi-reply conversations without requiring manual input.\nPreviously,AI-generated summaries had to be triggered manually. Now, they appear automatically at the top of selected emails. The Gemini assistant determines when a summary is relevant based on the structure and content of the conversation. Typically, summaries are generated for extended email threads or discussions with numerous responses. These summaries are presented as concise bullet points and update dynamically as new messages are added to the conversation.\nInitially, this feature is being made available toGoogle Workspace users,Google One subscribers with the AI Premium plan, andusers with Gemini Education add-ons. For now, it islimited to emails written in Englishandonly available on mobile devices.\nUsers who prefer not to use AI summaries can opt out, but doing so comes with a trade-off. Disabling this feature requires turning off Gmail’s “smart features” entirely. This action also disables useful functionalities such aspriority notifications,package tracking,smart reply, andwriting suggestions.\nThe summarization feature is powered bylarge language models (LLMs)—the same technology that underpins modern AI assistants and chatbots. These models analyze email content to generate summaries, and in turn, Google may use anonymized data from emails to improve its AI systems.\nBy introducing automatic AI summaries, Google signals a broader strategy to integrate generative AI into its core products. The update is part of an ongoing effort to enhance Gmail’s efficiency for users who manage high volumes of emails. However, there isno official timelinefor when this feature will become available forpersonal Gmail accountsor for theweb version of Gmail.\nFiled inCellphones.

    "title": "One In Four European Firms Ban Grok AI Chatbot Over Security Concerns",
    "content": "According to a new report by cybersecurity firmNetskope,25% of European organizations have banned Grok, the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk. The data indicatesa significant level of distrusttoward Grok compared to other AI tools currently in use across Europe.\nBy comparison,OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the most widely adopted AI application, is blocked by only9.8%of European firms, whileGoogle’s Geminiis restricted by9.2%. The discrepancy reflects growing scrutiny over how different AI platforms handlesecurity, privacy, and content moderation.\nGrok has recently come under fire forspreading misinformation, includingfalse narratives about a “white genocide” in South Africaandquestionable claims related to the Holocaust. These incidents have prompted many organizations toopt for alternatives perceived as more secure and reliable.\nNeil Thacker, Global Privacy and Data Protection Officer at Netskope, explained that the bans reflect increasing corporate awareness arounddata privacy, model transparency, anddata usage policies. Businesses are beginning to distinguish between AI apps based on how responsibly they handle user inputs and data training practices.\nThe report also shows that91% of European organizationsnow utilize cloud-based generative AI chatbots, indicating widespread adoption of AI technology. However,usage is selective: some tools face resistance due tolicensing, transparency, or privacy concerns.\nStable Diffusion, the image-generation AI developed by UK-based Stability AI, holds the title of the most blocked AI app in Europe, restricted by41% of organizations. It is frequently flagged due toprivacy risks or ambiguous licensing practices.\nGianpietro Cutolo, a cloud threat researcher at Netskope, noted that organizations are becoming more sophisticated in assessing thesecurity risks of specific AI platforms. This growing caution is particularly visible in the case of Grok, which, despite being branded by Musk as a “truth-seeking AI,” is losing credibility in the enterprise space.\nThe backlash against Grok comes amid broader reputational challenges for Musk, including a reported52% drop in Tesla’s sales in the EUlast month.

    "content": "Cross-border transactions are costing companies over $120 billion per year in transaction fees, a report by Oliver Wyman and J.P. Morgan found. In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient.\nAlthough originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments.\nIt can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger.\nWithin B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes.\nAs blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point. Will regulation complexities and slower integration stand in the way of blockchain truly reshaping the future ofB2Bpayments?\nGlobalB2B paymentsare still processed through an older, dated infrastructure despite improvements within fintech. Some significant problems hindering this include:\nMost companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees.\nForeign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions.\nKey cost factors include:\nCross-border B2B payments are settled for an average of two to five business days, usually due to time zones, bank holidays, and manual authentication procedures. TheSWIFTnetwork, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays.\nThis inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. The rising cost of cross-border transactions has generated a need for alternative payment methods, such as stablecoins and blockchain settlements.Lack of Transparency\nMany standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking. Consumer payments benefit from innovations like real-time payment networks, but cross-border business transactions still rely on traditional systems. Consequently, after initiating the payment, businesses hardly have any idea where the funds are at any point in time. The lack of transparency can lead to:\nWe're excited to announce the successful completion of a cross-chain Delivery versus Payment (DvP) transaction in collaboration with Kinexys by J.P. Morgan (@jpmorgan) and@OndoFinance.https://t.co/W2IC8NeO18This milestone marks the first-of-its-kind cross-chain, atomic…pic.twitter.com/0J1tA3AYWk\nCompliance Barriers\nThe limitations of anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), as well as counter-terrorist financing (CTF) can be quite restricting for cross-border B2B transactions. Regulations differ in each jurisdiction, and companies must go through a complex web of compliance requirements.\nSanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. The ever-changing nature of the regulations means that companies must continually update compliance systems, and this naturally adds to the expense of administrative costs and operating expenses.\nBlockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, andefficient payment systems. The biggest advantages of making use of blockchain-based B2B payments are:\nLowering Costs\nBlockchain eliminates the presence of intermediaries like correspondent banks, minimizing the cost of transactions in conventional payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly.\nFaster Settlement Times\nBlockchain payment technologies decrease cross-border payment delays from multiple days to just minutes, which unlike the multi-step payment processes of traditional payment systems, revolutionizes fintech cross-border innovation.\nThis is how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)facilitate faster paymentsbetween companies. Ethereum and Solana networks have been shown to be able to sustain high-speed, large-scale transactions without bank authorization, making them perfect for B2B settlements.\nTransparency & Security\nBlockchain employs a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store all the transactions in an open, fixed ledger. This degree of transparency thus enables businesses to see transactions in real-time, minimizing the scope for fraud and inefficiency in reconciliations. Compared to traditional banking infrastructure, where transaction histories might have been hidden due to banking regulations, blockchain provides an unerasable history of transactions.\nSmart Contracts\nBlockchain payment solutions can also facilitate compliance automation via smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded instructions to execute based on regulatory requirements.\nThe contracts can automate AML and KYC checks prior to a transaction,enhancing the regulatory complianceof blockchain payments. Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier.\nAI-Powered Fraud Detection\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI-powered systems can analyze transaction behavior in real time, detect suspicious behavior, and stop fraudulent payments from being sent.\nCyber crime Unit Hyderabad city as a part Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas conducted cyber awareness program about Parcel Scam&digital arrest, trading, APK files, Crypto currency, part time job& Investment, OTP, customer care, other social media trolling at State Bank of India Patny centrepic.twitter.com/AaS67Suloj\nAI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation. AI and blockchain together offer greater security levels and business operational efficiency improvement in B2B payments.\nThe Rise of Stablecoins in B2B Transactions\nStablecoins, digital currencies pledged against money, are emerging as a solution of choice for effortless B2B payments. The world's biggest banks and fintech giants, such as Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are moving into a space long dominated by Tether and Circle.\nWith increasing regulatory support, stablecoins provide a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional banking systems. Regulators now tackle concerns aboutstablecoin adoption, clearing the way for its inclusion in the global financial system.\nInstitutional Adoption\nFinancial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments.\nNotable institutional blockchain initiatives include:\nCBDCs and the Future of Government-Issued Digital Currencies\nWorld central banks are looking into the implementation of digital forms of their domestic currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The digital currency will be a safe, low-cost, and efficient payment medium that can replace cash and upgrade the payment system. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed.\nBlockchain must be able to seamlessly integrate with standard financial systems for it to be applied successfully in mass within B2B payments. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs.\nMeanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance.\nAs B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks. Whereas AML/KYC and CBDC regulations remain divided, efforts such as the Atlantic Council's digital asset policy roadmap are working towards creating international standards.\nPolicymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs,stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework. Regulatory sandboxes are empowering fintech companies to test blockchain solutions in pilot environments before implementing them on a full scale.\nSantander, one of the biggest banking groups in Europe, is using RippleNet to enable cross-border payments via its One Pay FX service. The blockchain technology enables Santander to settle payments in seconds, whereas the usual 3–5 business days for SWIFT-based payments are required.\nSantander launched a blockchain-based foreign exchange service that uses Ripple's technology.https://t.co/oPSPDuAP3Npic.twitter.com/YNTO3kt2k9\nThe bank has shown cost savings on cross-border remittances, proving the economic advantage of using blockchain.\nIBM's World Wire: A Cross-Border Payment Solution for Banks\nIBM’s World Wire uses the Stellar blockchain to enable cross-border payments between banks. The platform makes it possible for companies to pay in various digital assets, including stablecoins, offering a safe and regulatory-compliant payment method outside the traditional payment networks.\nWorld Wire has gone global, promoting financial inclusion and reducing global payment flows.

Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier.\nAI-Powered Fraud Detection\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI-powered systems can analyze transaction behavior in real time, detect suspicious behavior, and stop fraudulent payments from being sent.\nCyber crime Unit Hyderabad city as a part Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas conducted cyber awareness program about Parcel Scam&digital arrest, trading, APK files, Crypto currency, part time job& Investment, OTP, customer care, other social media trolling at State Bank of India Patny centrepic.twitter.com/AaS67Suloj\nAI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation. AI and blockchain together offer greater security levels and business operational efficiency improvement in B2B payments.\nThe Rise of Stablecoins in B2B Transactions\nStablecoins, digital currencies pledged against money, are emerging as a solution of choice for effortless B2B payments. The world's biggest banks and fintech giants, such as Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are moving into a space long dominated by Tether and Circle.\nWith increasing regulatory support, stablecoins provide a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional banking systems. Regulators now tackle concerns aboutstablecoin adoption, clearing the way for its inclusion in the global financial system.\nInstitutional Adoption\nFinancial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments.\nNotable institutional blockchain initiatives include:\nCBDCs and the Future of Government-Issued Digital Currencies\nWorld central banks are looking into the implementation of digital forms of their domestic currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The digital currency will be a safe, low-cost, and efficient payment medium that can replace cash and upgrade the payment system. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed.\nBlockchain must be able to seamlessly integrate with standard financial systems for it to be applied successfully in mass within B2B payments. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs.\nMeanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance.\nAs B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks. Whereas AML/KYC and CBDC regulations remain divided, efforts such as the Atlantic Council's digital asset policy roadmap are working towards creating international standards.\nPolicymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs,stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework. Regulatory sandboxes are empowering fintech companies to test blockchain solutions in pilot environments before implementing them on a full scale.\nSantander, one of the biggest banking groups in Europe, is using RippleNet to enable cross-border payments via its One Pay FX service. The blockchain technology enables Santander to settle payments in seconds, whereas the usual 3–5 business days for SWIFT-based payments are required.\nSantander launched a blockchain-based foreign exchange service that uses Ripple's technology.https://t.co/oPSPDuAP3Npic.twitter.com/YNTO3kt2k9\nThe bank has shown cost savings on cross-border remittances, proving the economic advantage of using blockchain.\nIBM's World Wire: A Cross-Border Payment Solution for Banks\nIBM’s World Wire uses the Stellar blockchain to enable cross-border payments between banks. The platform makes it possible for companies to pay in various digital assets, including stablecoins, offering a safe and regulatory-compliant payment method outside the traditional payment networks.\nWorld Wire has gone global, promoting financial inclusion and reducing global payment flows. Blockchain is revolutionizing B2B payments by offering reduced costs, quicker settlements, and improved transparency.",

    "title": "How SS&amp;C Intralinks is driving growth in Asia with AI-powered M&amp;A and seamless alternative investment fund management",
    "content": "Despite rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty around US policy, M&A and financing professionals remain optimistic about dealmaking in APAC. This confidence reflects the upbeat sentiment at the start of the year where 94% of respondents in the SS&C Intralinks ‘2025 APAC M&A Dealmakers Sentiment Report,’ produced with Reuters, anticipated increased deal activity, with nearly half predicting significant growth.\n“This tells us there was confidence and a renewed appetite for growth,” said Alex Turner, Vice President, Sales - Asia Pacific, at SS&C Intralinks. While the report was published before the latest bout of volatility, growth in early-stage M&A and fundraising activity continues. “Dealmakers are preparing to launch projects once the market settles.”\nTurner’s view reflects conducive conditions for deals – from more stable interest rates in key markets, to growth in China+1 supply-chain strategies, to plans to put dry powder to work. “As a result, we expect there will be a shift from middle-market deals to larger, high-value deals this year,” explained Turner.\nAt the same time, deal financing remains a key challenge, he added. “Over half of the dealmakers we surveyed expect financing conditions to become more difficult over the next year, with 28% identifying it as the most challenging aspect of dealmaking.”\nThis is no surprise. Today’s high-pressure environment may be more intense than ever, with economic volatility, geopolitical tensions and fragmented regulations compounding already tight deal timelines. Adding to the challenge is the exponential growth of the volume of data involved in due diligence — leaving little room for inefficiency.\nA more intelligent approach to doing deals\nSS&C Intralinks has spent years developing proprietary AI models and technologies to bring powerful, deal-ready innovation to its clients. In today’s environment, AI-driven insights are no longer optional — they’re essential to getting deals get done so firms can begin driving value from day one.\n“Those who can move quickly while making informed choices and demonstrating control over their data and workflows gain a real competitive edge,” explained Turner.\nThe ability to efficiently ingest, analyse and act on an overwhelming volume of information through automation can help to alleviate many bottlenecks that have traditionally slowed down transactions, he added. “Whether it’s consolidating and analysing massive volumes of due diligence data, streamlining investor communication, or maintaining full visibility across complex deal structures, smarter workflows are enabling teams to work faster and more confidently across borders and stakeholder groups.”\nUsing AI is becoming essential to meet evolving expectations from investors, advisors and regulators in terms of real-time reporting and auditable transparency. In fact, 98% of respondents in the survey said they expect AI-powered tools in M&A and financing to increase in the coming year.\nYet with adoption in its early stages, the goal is to find the right partners and solutions that offer robust AI features plus align with the regulatory and security requirements of a specific industry.\n“This is one of the key reasons the next generation of the SS&C Intralinks platform has been built to fully integrate AI into the tools, analytics and workflows used by dealmakers in DealCentre AI™,” said Turner.\nFinding new ways to fuel fundraising\nSpeed and transparency have become increasingly key success factors for fundraising, too.\nAccording to Turner, a mindset shift among fund managers has led to an increasing focus on managing the entire experience for limited partners (LPs) and other investors end-to-end, from fundraising to onboarding to reporting.\n“As fundraising cycles lengthen and investor attention becomes more fragmented, general partners (GPs) need to offer a more personalised and intuitive investor experience that builds trust throughout the entire fundraising cycle,” he added.\nUltimately, the fund managers that will thrive in this environment are the ones that treat fundraising as more of a dynamic and data-informed process that moves with the investor and the market.\nThis will therefore meet the increasingly selective approach LPs are taking when it comes to the quality, transparency and timeliness of information they receive. “It’s that level of visibility that gives them the confidence to commit capital,” Turner added.\nLiving up to changing expectations\nAs AI becomes more embedded in dealmaking and fundraising, technology needs to feel intuitive and purposeful. Achieving this will close the gap between what Turner calls “the promise of AI and the day-to-day reality for most teams”.\nThis is the foundation of thoughtful guidance and partnership, aimed at achieving key goals such as:\nUnderpinning the solutions, however, is a commitment to service, said Turner. “Technology is essential, but one of our most valuable differentiators is the depth of our industry expertise. Having supported trillions in transactions, our experience shapes every decision we make — and that’s what keeps us at the forefront of innovation in dealmaking.”\nClick here for more details onSS&C Intralinks,DealCentre AIandFundCentre™\nReference sources",
