The innovative design uses a folded optical structure and moving parts to switch between two distinct optical focal lengths. According to tech blogger Digital Chat Station, the switch between focal lengths is not seamless, as software is used to bridge the gap. Huawei is also testing true continuous optical zoom, which is not yet ready.

    "title": "Opinion: Space startups are pivoting to defence. That’s great for innovation",
    "content": "Afew months ago, atthe SmallSat Symposium, a panel issued a sobering warning to space startups: do not chase defence dollars at the expense of long-term sustainability. Why? Because companies, particularly in the space sector, might be tempted to follow the money rather than focus on producing valuable products and services with broader, longer-term applications. It’s of course true thatanycompany should be wary of “leaning in” too closely to what seem like passing fads. But the warning overlooks an important reality: the shift towards defence investing is not a trend. It’s a transformation in space and space investment, and one that will have positive — albeit unintended — consequences.\nAcross the space sector, there has been a noticeable shift towards focusing on pure defence investing. Companies that once prioritised commercial applications, or at most maintained dual-use business models, are now making full-scale pivots to defence. Needless to say, that move isn’t random. It’s the product of geopolitical changes, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and a widespread belief that the world is changing. As Michael Gove, who served in the Cabinets of four British prime ministers,put it recently: “The ideal of a rules-based international order, where multilateral institutions restrain states pursuing their self-interest, has proved to be a false hope… we are back to a world closer to that ofThucydidesin which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”\nThe change is happening at the public sector level, too. In 2024, global governmental expenditure onspaceprogrammes surged to $135 billion (€119 billion) — up 10% from the year before. The primary driver was rising defence budgets. Arecent Bruegel reportconcluded that without support from the United States, “Europe could need 300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion” to keep the continent safe. As geopolitical tensions rise, governments worldwide have been funnelling money into space-based defence technology, a recognition that the sector is the cornerstone of any modern military.\nOne of the unintended yet highly beneficial consequences of this shift amongstartupsis its impact on the private space sector. Increased defence investment is breathing new life into aerospace and deep-tech innovation. Companies that previously struggled to secure commercial funding are now benefiting from sustained government investment, allowing them to work on cutting-edge technologies. These include (among many others) optical communications, needed for secure and high-speed space-based data transmission; Earth observation, crucial for climate monitoring, disaster response, and resource management; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), enabling all-weather, day-and-night imaging capabilities with high precision.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nDespite the opportunities that await here, moving from purely commercial to defence markets is not without its hurdles. Startups can face significant challenges. Government contracts often come withdelayed payments and long procurement cycles, creating cashflow issues for smaller firms that lack financial reserves. Defence-related technologies are subject to stringent export controls and compliance requirements, heaping bureaucratic burdens on startups that many are ill-equipped to bear.\nBut for those companies that make the pivot successfully, the rewards far outweigh these obstacles. Defence funding provides long-term stability and a runway for companies to develop world-class technology that may later be commercialised in other sectors. In other words, to pivot into space isn’t necessarily to leave behind the commercial world.\nSome startups are making full-blown pivots to defence, but the real sweet spot remains in the world of dual-use technology — those innovations that serve both commercial and defence markets. Companies that maintain this balance benefit from diverse revenue streams, greater resilience to market fluctuations, and the ability to shift emphasis as commercial demand evolves.\nThe success of this dual-use approach is plain to see in the companies that have seamlessly integrated their offerings across sectors. Take the SAR satellite company ICEYE, whose data is used in flood response, maritime activity monitoring, andconflict zones like Ukraine. Or FibreCoat, whose advanced materials protect satellites from the harsh conditions of space, regardless of what those satellites are used for.\nGiven the scale of government investment, as well as the ongoing volatility in the broader geopolitical landscape, it’s highly unlikely that the present shift in focus towards defence is merely a fad. There is anew world orderin place, and national security considerations will play a defining role in geopolitics for years to come.\nHowever, the space sector’s ultimate goal should be a balanced ecosystem where defence and commercial efforts reinforce one another. The current surge in defence spending is helping accelerate technological innovation, funding infrastructure that will benefit the commercial sector in the long run. As companies continue to develop dual-use applications, they can ensure that the innovations sparked by defence priorities also drive broader commercial progress.\nThat’s good news because space touches almost every area of modern life. It’s the backbone of the world economy. It plays a vital role in navigation, communication, connectivity, and sustainability. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion (€1.58 trillion) by 2035, accordingto a reportby McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. We may well be entering anew golden agefor the industry, one in which entrepreneurs have access to more capital, investors are more willing to back high-risk ventures, and technology development is progressing at an unprecedented pace.\nIf companies can navigate the challenges of defence contracting while remaining mindful of the broader commercial applications of their products, the entire space ecosystem stands to benefit. For startups, the key will be balancing short-term defence opportunities with long-term strategic growth, so ensuring that today’s pivot does not become tomorrow’s dead end. But if the evolution towards greater defence investing is managed wisely by all involved parties, it could propel the space industry into its most vibrant era yet.\nDefence tech will be a hot topic atTNW Conference, which takes place inAmsterdam on June 19-20.Tickets for the event arenow on sale— use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the checkout to get 30% off.\nBogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stag(show all)Bogdan Gogulan is the CEO and Managing Partner of NewSpace Capital, the world’s first private equity firm devoted exclusively to growth-stage companies working in the space technology sector.

For many, it’s shaping up to be a full-time job, with some even employing a team to manage their operations.\nLivestreaming and “shoppable” video content have been booming in China for years, where platforms like Douyin (TikTok’s Chinese equivalent) and Taobao host thousands of daily livestreams.Over 600 million Chinese consumersregularly watch shopping live streams, and the breadth of what they can buy through this medium is staggering. A newlife insurance policy,still wriggling crabsdirect from a small village farmer, a discountedMcDonald’s chicken sandwich, asecondhand car— the list goes on. Top live sellers, often called “Key Opinion Leaders” such asAustin Li (aka The Lipstick King) have built mega followings and can easily generate $100mn (€88mn) in sales in a single session. In 2024, the Chinese livestream commerce market reached5.86 trillion yuan,equivalent to about€715bn. By 2026, it’s projected to reach 8.16 trillion yuan (€996bn).\nWhile China will forever remain streets ahead, the medium is undeniably taking root in Europe. On Whatnot’s platform, there’s been a600% year-on-yearincrease in European sellers specifically, and they host more than 20,000 hours of live shows a week. Over half (59%) generate the majority of their revenue from live selling, which rises to 70% for UK sellers, according to the platform’s data from early 2025. This real-time, interactive approach to shopping is attractive for small resale businesses, but is also pulling in passionate buyers-turned-sellers, many of whom have never been in front of an audience before.\nIt chimes with a trend thatSam Shaw, strategy director at cultural insights practiceCanvas8, has been tracking for over a decade — the desire to be your own boss, which is especially prevalent among younger generations. Nearlytwo-thirds of people aged 18 to 35say they’ve started a side gig to supplement their income, or plan to start one, according to a survey by Intuit. Nearly half of those surveyed say their primary motivation for starting a side hustle is to be their own boss. “There’s a strong desire for independence and to build something personal,” says Shaw. “Live selling lets people turn their interests or products into a business.”\nAndrew Tubman, for example, hadn’t heard of live selling before he attended the London Card Show with his young son in 2023. A punter with a penchant for Pokémon cards, it was here that he first came across Whatnot. He downloaded the app and used it to buy more trading cards, and spent big on several limited edition Disney collections. “I was watching how livestreamers were doing it, what works and what doesn’t,” explains the 35-year-old from Cranleigh, Surrey. “Then I took the leap to do my first show as a seller in February last year — it was addictive.”\nWorking a 48-hour week in the motor trade industry, Andrew — known as@TubmanBreakson Whatnot — managed to fit in a couple of shows weekly, selling sports and entertainment trading cards. He began to see that it could be a viable sideline business. Less than two months after Andrew and his wife Chantel registered as a company, it was clear that demand was high, and live selling alongside the day job wasn’t sustainable.\n“At least six nights a week, I was streaming all night, then staying up to pack the cards for postage — it was exhausting,” explains Andrew. “I’d been doing my full-time job for a decade, and although stable, I didn’t enjoy it — it was just to pay the bills and put food on the table for my three kids.” Since leaving his salaried role and putting everything into the business in the spring of 2024, Andrew hasn’t looked back. Monthly turnover now easily exceeds £1mn (€1.2mn), with Andrew and his wife each paying themselves an annual salary of £50,000 (€59,600). “It’s not been a get-rich-quick scheme though — we’ve put a lot of hours in, and plenty of revenue has gone straight back into the business so we can grow,” he says.\nIn a sea of social selling platforms, why is Whatnot netting so many sellers? First off, the earning potential is hard to ignore. Andrew’s balance sheet is far from an anomaly on Whatnot. Almost two-thirds(65%) of European live sellersare making more than £10,000 (€11,900) a month, and one in four earn over £50,000 (€59,600) a month. They have an eye on further growth too — 78% plan to expand their efforts this year.\nUp against other live selling platforms, Whatnot’s seller fees are largely aligned. In Europe, it charges astandard commission feeof 6.67% plus VAT on the final price, compared toTikTok Shop, which raised its UK seller fees from 5% to 9% in 2024, andInstagram Live, which charges a 5% selling fee per shipment. For shipments that are £7.96 (€9.49) or less, a flat fee of 23p (€0.27) is charged instead. Fee comparisons with static selling platforms like eBay and Poshmark are almost pointless, though, as many are battling to keep fees low or eliminate them entirely. For example, there are no seller fees on Vinted; instead, the platform collects 5% and €0.70 per item from the buyer.\nJon-Luc Greenwood, 26, from Manchester, UK, has been in the resale business across several platforms since he left college over 10 years ago, and had been predominantly making a living selling clothes on eBay until he discovered Whatnot. He met girlfriend Char Williams three years ago after she asked him for business advice, and not long after, moved down to live with her in Plymouth, Devon.\n“I have a degree in beauty promotion, and worked across several cosmetics counters, but a period of ill health meant I couldn’t work a normal nine-to-five job,” says 27-year-old Char, who stumbled upon selling on apps while recovering. With Char’s knowledge of makeup and skincare, and Jon-Luc’s resale expertise, they set up as@jonlucandcharon Whatnot in November 2023. Within months, the pendulum of earnings swung from eBay to Whatnot.\nSoon, 90% of their income was generated through the livestream app and by Q4 of 2024, weekly sales reached £15,000 (€18,000) a week. For them, the draw is “instant gratification” and the ability to shift a high volume of products, for example, through flash sales, yet also garner high bids for one-off editions. Payment for shipping is integrated within the platform, which saves hours when selling thousands of goods at a time.\nWhen asked about the benefits of Whatnot over other platforms, increased sales volumes came outtop (43%) for European live sellerstoo, followed by larger revenue (42%). Naturally, sellers get a kick out of seeing their earnings tick up in real-time as they stream, but Jon-Luc, Char, and Andrew all highlight the boost they get from their audiences too. “Most of my friends think I’m mad for buying pieces of shiny cardboard, but through this, I’ve met so many new friends and people I speak to on a daily basis via WhatsApp,” says Andrew.\nJon-Luc points out that with skincare and beauty being strongly rooted in community, their livestreams have become a social space too, with many of the same women joining. Some watch every minute of every stream — roughly 20 hours a week, spread across three evenings. They might not shop, but they just like being there. “Everyone comes and talks about their day or their problems in the chat,” says Jon-Luc. “We also have aFacebookcommunity page where people put photos of themselves using our products, ask questions, and make suggestions of what they want next — we can see people getting really friendly with one another.”\nChar compares livestreaming to “being on FaceTime with a friend,” and often tailors recommendations to individual budgets and medical needs like rosacea or severe acne. “Ultimately, I’m putting on a show, so the banter and giveaways need to be good, but it’s making people feel less alone too — they’re finding a companionship they might not get elsewhere,” explains Char. “I spend eight hours at a time talking to these people so I get to know them.” With all the adrenaline, she says the minutes fly by, and she’s more than accustomed to talking continuously on camera, having built up “the live presenting muscle”.\nTypically, Char goes live from the warehouse at 5pm, finishes at 1am, goes home to cook dinner, and is asleep by 3am. The day after a show is spent packing goods and breathing a sigh of relief, she says. While there’s a physical, location-based element to this kind of work — holding up items and having space to store and pack them afterwards — there’s a freedom to it too. With the right kind of organisation, portable tech, and staff to pack and send items, live sellers can broadcast from anywhere. “We went live for an hour when we were on holiday in Dubai, and sold thousands of pounds worth of stuff,” says Jon-Luc.\nWhile videocommerce — or v-commerce — may be just nudging at mainstream status in Europe, the videoification of almost everything else, from podcasts and news to education and medical care, is at fever pitch level. Research by network insights firmSandvinefound that live and on-demand video constituted an estimated 62.46% of EMEA internet traffic by volume in 2022. And at the end of last year,Ericsson’s 2024 Mobility Reportfound that video traffic was anticipated to account for 74% of all global mobile data traffic.“If we’re already FaceTiming, Zooming, and doing Google Hangouts, why would we continue to shop static?” says Maryam Ghahremani, CEO ofBambuser, a social commerce platform that works with brands likeAudi,Sonos, andZarato produce livestream and shoppable content. “Shopping and e-commerce will, over time, pivot into video, because customers are already spending their time with that medium.” McKinsey predicts that by 2026,20% of online saleswill flow through live shopping platforms.\nIn the brand space, Ghahremani has seen live selling move from “nice-to-have to a standard e-commerce channel” in a short space of time. Founded in 2007 with a focus on mobile broadcasting and citizen journalism, the Swedish-born Bambuser now works on providing retailers with the technology to produce live selling content across any digital channel, saving them from hiring a production and web development team.\nLooking to the future, Ghahremani expects more large brands to begin training up their internal staff to be live sellers. Whether it’s floor staff, shop assistants, buyers, or directors, they already know the products inside-out, and so only require training in being on camera and using the technology. Electricals storeCurrysbegan by offering one-way video calls between customers and in-store staff members, which has grown into theUK retail industry’s largest video commerce channel, with designated spaces in physical stores for staff to live sell and advise.\nReliability and a human touch certainly play a role in the v-commerce influx, in part, driven by the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, which sees people having to do more thorough research into purchases. A report from 2025 found that55% of European consumerscan’t afford to make the wrong choice, with quality and trust now trumping price. “While live selling in China is transactional, I see the shift in EMEA and the US being more about brand storytelling, transparency, and education,” says Ghahremani. “People aren’t going with just the goal of shopping — they want to be entertained, and educated with brand or product knowledge.”\nAs major players like TikTok Shop, Instagram Live, Whatnot, and Amazon Live work to create and develop full-stack ecosystems that transition from video to checkout seamlessly, more people are going to find themselves live selling on the side — by chance and by design. “Europeans are choosing live selling over traditional jobs because they’re disappointed with conventional career paths and as regular wages aren’t covering expenses, they’re looking for other ways to make money,” says Shaw, of Canvas8. “Live selling seems to offer the chance to set their own hours and directly profit from their efforts.”\nTapping aspects of the gig economy, influencer culture and direct peer-to-peer sales, this model may grant relative freedom, but effectively paves the way for a never-ending hustle. Jon-Luc and Char already have one staff member who manages packing and postage, but want to hire a full-time seller who could stream during the day, making it an almost 24-hour operation. As Char points out: “We know other streamers who are constantly live, and just move from one stream to another throughout the day and into the night — after all, if you’re not live, you’re not making money.”\nMegan Carnegie is a London-based independent journalist who specialises in writing features about the world of technology, work, and busines(show all)Megan Carnegie is a London-based independent journalist who specialises in writing features about the world of technology, work, and business for publications like WIRED, Business Insider, Digital Frontier and BBC.

    "title": "WhatsApp Now Allows Users Forwarding Media To Meta AI For Analysis",
    "content": "WhatsApp is introducing a new feature that allows users to forwardphotos, videos, and texttoMeta AI, the platform’s integrated chatbot, for content analysis. Initiallyreleasedthrough thebeta channel (version 2.25.18.8 for Android), the feature is also gradually rolling out to some stable users.\nWith this new capability, Meta AI can analyze forwarded content to providecontextual information, such as identifying thelocation where a photo was taken,describing images,cross-referencing data, and evenverifying the authenticity of viral videos. This function aims to enhance the chatbot’s utility, especially for users seeking quick insights about media content.\nAccording to WhatsApp, the feature has potentialanti-misinformation benefits. By enabling users to verify forwarded content using Meta AI, the tool could become avaluable asset in combating fake news and misinformation, particularly in viral media shared across chats.\nIn terms ofprivacy, Meta AI only accesses contentexplicitly shared by the user. All shared data isend-to-end encryptedduring transmission and isdeleted from cloud serversafter processing. This approach is designed to maintain user trust and uphold WhatsApp’s strong privacy standards.\nTo use the feature, users canselect a photo or video, tap thesharebutton, and check ifMeta AIappears as a sharing option. If it does, the content can be forwarded directly to the chatbot for analysis and feedback.\nThis enhancement follows another recent update to WhatsApp, which introducednew animationsfor sending media, further improving the overall user experience. Additionally, WhatsApp is also testing anew method to copy message content, indicating the company’s broader effort to refine user interactions and expand the app’s functionality.\nThese updates reflect Meta’s ongoing push to integrate AI-driven tools across its platforms, with WhatsApp now becoming a more intelligent and interactive messaging environment. As AI integration deepens, more features like this are likely to emerge, giving users enhanced ways to understand and manage shared content.\nFiled inCellphones>Robots.

    "content": "Apple is expected to unveiliOS 26—previously referred to as iOS 19—onJune 9duringWWDC 2025, and new rumors suggest the update will introducea series of minor but useful improvementsacross several native apps. These updates will complement iOS 26’srefreshed visual designand its integration withApple Intelligence, Apple’s evolving AI framework.\nAccording to sources from9to5Mac, Apple is quietly preparingfive small enhancementsacross its core iOS apps to deliver a more polished and intelligent user experience.\nStarting with theMessages app, users can expect two key additions:\nApple Music now has an animated art feature in iOS 17pic.twitter.com/PfF2nwCsYa\n— Apple Hub (@theapplehub)September 15, 2023\n\nApple Musicwill also gain a visual enhancement. Theanimated album covers, introduced in iOS 17, will now be displayed on thelock screen, bringing a more dynamic and stylish aesthetic to music playback while aligning with the broader visual updates of iOS 26.\nIn theNotes app, users will finally receiveMarkdown file support—a long-requested feature.

    "title": "GMail Introduces AI Summaries By Default On Android And iOS",
    "content": "Googlehas begun rolling outautomatic AI-generated email summaries in the GMail app for Android and iOS. This update representsa shift from Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, being an optional feature to becoming a standard tool for certain users. The aim is to provide a quicker overview of long or multi-reply conversations without requiring manual input.\nPreviously,AI-generated summaries had to be triggered manually. Now, they appear automatically at the top of selected emails. The Gemini assistant determines when a summary is relevant based on the structure and content of the conversation. Typically, summaries are generated for extended email threads or discussions with numerous responses. These summaries are presented as concise bullet points and update dynamically as new messages are added to the conversation.\nInitially, this feature is being made available toGoogle Workspace users,Google One subscribers with the AI Premium plan, andusers with Gemini Education add-ons. For now, it islimited to emails written in Englishandonly available on mobile devices.\nUsers who prefer not to use AI summaries can opt out, but doing so comes with a trade-off. Disabling this feature requires turning off Gmail’s “smart features” entirely. This action also disables useful functionalities such aspriority notifications,package tracking,smart reply, andwriting suggestions.\nThe summarization feature is powered bylarge language models (LLMs)—the same technology that underpins modern AI assistants and chatbots. These models analyze email content to generate summaries, and in turn, Google may use anonymized data from emails to improve its AI systems.\nBy introducing automatic AI summaries, Google signals a broader strategy to integrate generative AI into its core products. The update is part of an ongoing effort to enhance Gmail’s efficiency for users who manage high volumes of emails. However, there isno official timelinefor when this feature will become available forpersonal Gmail accountsor for theweb version of Gmail.\nFiled inCellphones.

    "content": "According to a new report by cybersecurity firmNetskope,25% of European organizations have banned Grok, the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk. The data indicatesa significant level of distrusttoward Grok compared to other AI tools currently in use across Europe.\nBy comparison,OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the most widely adopted AI application, is blocked by only9.8%of European firms, whileGoogle’s Geminiis restricted by9.2%. The discrepancy reflects growing scrutiny over how different AI platforms handlesecurity, privacy, and content moderation.\nGrok has recently come under fire forspreading misinformation, includingfalse narratives about a “white genocide” in South Africaandquestionable claims related to the Holocaust. These incidents have prompted many organizations toopt for alternatives perceived as more secure and reliable.\nNeil Thacker, Global Privacy and Data Protection Officer at Netskope, explained that the bans reflect increasing corporate awareness arounddata privacy, model transparency, anddata usage policies. Businesses are beginning to distinguish between AI apps based on how responsibly they handle user inputs and data training practices.\nThe report also shows that91% of European organizationsnow utilize cloud-based generative AI chatbots, indicating widespread adoption of AI technology. However,usage is selective: some tools face resistance due tolicensing, transparency, or privacy concerns.\nStable Diffusion, the image-generation AI developed by UK-based Stability AI, holds the title of the most blocked AI app in Europe, restricted by41% of organizations. It is frequently flagged due toprivacy risks or ambiguous licensing practices.\nGianpietro Cutolo, a cloud threat researcher at Netskope, noted that organizations are becoming more sophisticated in assessing thesecurity risks of specific AI platforms. This growing caution is particularly visible in the case of Grok, which, despite being branded by Musk as a “truth-seeking AI,” is losing credibility in the enterprise space.\nThe backlash against Grok comes amid broader reputational challenges for Musk, including a reported52% drop in Tesla’s sales in the EUlast month.
