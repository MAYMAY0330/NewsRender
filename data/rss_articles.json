To work on a team led byformer Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wangand at a desk physically near Zuckerberg, Meta has reportedly offered employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMindcompensation packages worth upwards of $100 million.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed those reports on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman, which waspublished on Tuesday.However, the OpenAI CEO noted that Zuckerberg‚Äôs recruiting efforts have been largely unsuccessful and made sure to throw a few more digs at Meta in the process.\nNew episode of Uncapped with@sama. Enjoy ü§ópic.twitter.com/2IxYt3B4Gm\n‚Äú[Meta has] started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team,‚Äù Sam Altman said on the podcast. ‚ÄúYou know, like, $100 million signing bonuses, more than that [in] compensation per year [‚Ä¶] I‚Äôm really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.‚Äù\nThe OpenAI CEO said he believed his employees made the assessment that OpenAI had a better chance of achieving AGI and may one day be the more valuable company. He also said he believes Meta‚Äôs focus on high compensation packages for employees, rather than the mission of delivering AGI, would likely not create a great culture.\nMeta reportedly tried topoachone of OpenAI‚Äôs lead researchers, Noam Brown, as well as Google‚Äôs AI architect, Koray Kavukcuoglu. However, both efforts were unsuccessful.\nSam Altman went on to say he believes OpenAI‚Äôs culture of innovation has been a major key to its success, and that Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrent AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.‚Äù The OpenAI CEO said he respects many things about Meta but noted he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink they‚Äôre a company that‚Äôs great at innovation.‚Äù Later in the podcast, Altman said he believes it‚Äôs not enough for companies to catch up on AI ‚Äî they have to truly innovate to stay ahead.\nThe OpenAI CEO‚Äôs comments highlight some of the challenges that Meta has to overcome in order to build out a successful AI superintelligence lab. Besides bringing on Wang, Meta announced last week that itinvested significantlyin Wang‚Äôs former company, Scale AI. The company has also reportedlynabbed a few star AI researchers, such as Google DeepMind‚Äôs Jack Rae and Sesame AI‚Äôs Johan Schalkwyk. But there‚Äôs more work ahead.\nIn the coming year, Meta will have to staff up its new AI team while OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind operate at full speed. In the coming months, OpenAI is expected torelease an open AI modelthat‚Äôs likely to set Meta back in the AI race even further.\nLater on in the podcast, Sam Altman described an AI-powered social media feed that seems likely to encroach on Meta‚Äôs apps. The OpenAI CEO said he‚Äôs curious about exploring a social media app that uses AI to deliver custom feeds based on what users want, rather than the default, algorithmic feed that exists on traditional social media apps.\nOpenAI is reportedlyworking on a social networking appinternally. Meanwhile, Meta is experimenting with an AI-powered social network through its Meta AI app. However, it seems that some users are confused by the Meta AI app and have shared somehyperpersonal chats with the broader world.\nWhether AI-powered social networks take off remains to be seen.

It says, ‚ÄúUnder this award, the performer will develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.‚Äù\nWhether that reference to war-fighting applies to the weapons themselves or just other areas associated with wars, like paperwork, remains to be seen. OpenAI‚Äôs guidelines do forbid individual users to use ChatGPT or its APIs to develop or use weapons. However, OpenAI deleted the explicit prohibitions of ‚Äúmilitary and warfare‚Äù in its terms of service backin January 2024.\nGiven how heavily some powerful people in Silicon Valley have warned of the dangers of China‚Äôs advanced LLM models, it‚Äôs not surprising the DoD wants to use OpenAI for whatever purposes it wants. For instance, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, an OpenAI investor, recently appeared on Jack Altman‚Äôs ‚ÄúUncapped‚Äù podcast (Jack is Sam Altman‚Äôs brother). Andreessen described the race between China‚Äôs AI andthe Western world‚Äôs models as a ‚Äúcold war.‚Äù\nStill, perhaps an equally interesting part of this announcement is what it says about OpenAI‚Äôsincreasingly strained relationship with its major investor Microsoft.\nMicrosofthas thousands of contractswith the federal government worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It has, for decades, been implementing the strict security protocols necessary for the government ‚Äî especially the DoD ‚Äî to use its cloud.\nOpenAI announced this deal as part of its broader new ‚ÄúOpenAI for Government‚Äù program, which consolidates a number of other programs it uses to sell wares directly to government agencies, including the U.S. National Labs‚Å†, the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, NIH, and the Treasury, according to the company.\nBut it was only in April thatMicrosoft announcedthe DoD had approved its Azure OpenAI Service for all classified levels.

The problem has reduced the visibility of users‚Äô posts because many people on the platform have configured their settings to hide mature content by default.\nAccording to numerous posts from impacted Tumblr users, posts have been falsely flagged despite not being sexual or violent, and these false takedowns have included everything fromcat GIFs to fandom contenttoartand even apicture of hands. Some suspect that AI-based automation could be to blame for the issues.\nSimilar accusations have plagued other social media platforms in recent weeks. For instance, Pinterest finally admitted that an internal errorled to its mass user bans. Meanwhile, Instagram this week declined tocomment on its own trouble with mass bansthat users said have been given little coverage or attention outside of online complaints on apps like X and Reddit.\nIn both cases, users suspected that AI-based moderation was to blame, though Pinterest denied that was the case.\nOn Tumblr, the flagging issue is tied to an update to the Android app, where the company said it‚Äôs been experimenting with improvements to its mature content filtering systems. Specifically, it was testing out a new layer of moderation toContent Labels, the company told TechCrunch.\nA spokesperson for Tumblr said the experiments are continuing and, based on user feedback, will be improved before the changes roll out to other platforms.\n‚ÄúAs we work to make Tumblr a safer place for all users, we aim to respect a diverse set of interests and content preferences, which can be adjusted in settings. We view this as an ongoing process as we continue to fine-tune how we detect and address mature content,‚Äù a Tumblr spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company alsoacknowledged the problem on its blog, responding to a user‚Äôs question about the falsely flagged posts. Here, Tumblr‚Äôs team noted they were aware of the ‚Äúincorrect classification issues‚Äù and were actively working to reduce them.\nIn addition, the post explained that Tumblr‚Äôs appeal process was being updated in the weeks ahead to be able to handle a higher volume of cases. (Tumblr did not respond to our questions about the appeals process‚Äô planned changes.)\nWhether AI or other automation is to blame is not clear, as Tumblr wouldn‚Äôt speak specifically to the cause of the new issues. However, the reduced staffing at the blogging service has likely also played a role.\nFollowing its 2019acquisitionby WordPress.com maker Automattic,Tumblr has faced layoffsas its staff was reassigned toother projects at the parent company. Last year, Automattic announced that Tumblr‚Äôs back end would also bemoved to WordPressto make management easier and stemits financial losses.\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.\nAnysphere CEO Michael Truell said in the blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans ‚Äî ranging from$100 a monthto$250 a month‚Äî as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users and offer them increased usage.\nThe new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere‚Äôs already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor hadreached $500 million in annualized recurring revenueand is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe.\nAnysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down. Based onTechCrunch‚Äôs previous reporting, Cursor‚Äôs ARR has grown by $200 million since April.\nHowever, the race to develop ‚Äúvibe-coding‚Äù tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedlyacquired Cursor‚Äôs competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.\nIt‚Äôs unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We‚Äôve seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recentlyslashed Windsurf‚Äôs direct access to Claude AI modelsas a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.\nAt the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources toward developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out anew ‚ÄúTab‚Äù AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.\nIn a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere‚Äôs multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren‚Äôt going anywhere just yet.

    "content": "On June 15, Luo Yonghao‚Äôs digital avatar hosted its first livestream on Baidu‚Äôs e-commerce platform, attracting more than 13 million views and generating over 55 million yuan ($7.66 million) in gross merchandise value. Several 3C and food product categories reportedly surpassed the sales figures from Luo‚Äôs real-person debut in May, marking a new high for AI-driven livestreams. The session featured several technical firsts for the industry. It was the first time a top-tier Chinese influencer was represented by an AI-generated avatar for an entire livestream, which lasted more than six hours. The stream also introduced multi-avatar interaction, with Luo‚Äôs avatar and a co-host engaging in synchronized gestures and banter, mimicking real human behavior. According to Baidu, the AI system drew from a 13,000-item knowledge base and generated 97,000 words of product descriptions, coordinating more than 8,300 avatar movements during the session. Luo, founder of Smartisan Technology and Thin Red Line, began livestreaming sales on Douyin to pay off his debts. He continued until 2022, when he announced his exit from all social media to focus on Thin Red Line. [Technode report]",

    "content": "Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai has revealed that the company‚Äôs engineers worked through the Chinese New Year holiday to accelerate AI development after the company felt pressured by DeepSeek‚Äôs breakthrough. Speaking at the VivaTech conference in Paris, Tsai said DeepSeek‚Äôs low-cost, high-performance AI model which launched in January shocked the industry and exposed Alibaba‚Äôs lag in the field. ‚ÄúWe read the research papers and we said, ‚ÄòHoly cow, how come we have fallen behind? We were doing the same things,‚Äô‚Äù Tsai said. ‚ÄúWhat happened was our engineering lead decided and said, ‚ÄòCancel your Chinese New Year holiday, everybody stay in the company, sleep in the office, we‚Äôre going to accelerate our development.‚Äô‚Äù Within weeks, Alibaba released its Qwen series models. The sudden, intense push from one of China‚Äôs biggest tech companies reflects the impact of DeepSeek‚Äôs development as well as Alibaba‚Äôs strategic pivot toward AI after a two-year restructuring focused on e-commerce and cloud computing. Tsai emphasized that making Qwen open source is aimed at popularizing AI use and boosting demand for cloud services. Alibaba plans to invest over $53 billion in AI infrastructure over three years and has partnered with Apple to provide AI technology for iPhones. Despite these efforts, Tsai acknowledged ongoing challenges, with Alibaba‚Äôs revenue growing just 7% in Q1 2024. [Bloomburg,SCMP]",

    "content": "Munich-based defence tech startup Helsing has raised‚Ç¨600mn as geopolitical tensions trigger a flood of capital into AI warfare.\nThe large investment was led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek‚Äôs VC firm Prima Materia. Itbrings the company‚Äôs total raised to north of ‚Ç¨1.3bn,building on a‚Ç¨450mn funding round in Julylast year.\nHelsing didn‚Äôt disclose its updated valuation. However, according to theFinancial Times, the unicorn company is now worth ‚Ç¨12bn, making it one of Europe‚Äôs five most valuable private tech companies.\nPrima Materiawas one of Helsing‚Äôs earliest backers ‚Äî a move that sparkedboycottsamong artists on Spotify, who feared their use of the platform was helping to fund war.That backlash clearly hasn‚Äôt deterred Ek, though, who said Helsing‚Äôs technology ensures ‚Äústrategic autonomy‚Äù for Europe.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\n‚ÄúBy doubling down on our investment, Prima Materia reaffirms its commitment to empowering Europe‚Äôs technological sovereignty ‚Äî an ambition Helsing perfectly embodies,‚Äù said Ek.\nFounded in 2021, Helsing has developed an autonomous strike drone now in use by several European militaries, including Ukraine‚Äôs. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomousreconnaissance submarines, and last week successfully used its self-driving system to pilot a Saab fighter jet.\nHelsing is riding a defence investment boom as war in Ukraine and rising security concerns push European governments to double down on military spending and explore AI technologies for warfare.\nAccording to a new reportfrom McKinsey,investment in European defence techstartupsrose by over 500% between 2021 and 2024 compared to the previous three years.\nWhile Helsing is currently Europe‚Äôs most valuable defence tech startup, many other companies are experiencing rising demand for their technologies.\nIn May,Germandual-use drone makerQuantum Systems raised ‚Ç¨160mn at a valuation north of ‚Ç¨1bn, shortly after Portuguese drone startup Tekever also reached the coveted unicorn status.\nARX Robotics, another Munich-based company, recently raised ‚Ç¨31mn to expand its fleet ofautonomous land drones, shortly after announcing itsplans to invest ¬£45mn into anew UK factory.\nKate Leaman, chief market analyst at online broker AvaTrade,previously told TNWthat military tech companies have ‚Äúhuge potential‚Äù for growth ‚Äî particularly those with AI-driven solutions.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,‚Äù Leaman said. ‚ÄúThis suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.‚Äù\nSi√¥n is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "content": "Qubits, entanglement, superposition, trapped ions, Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat. These termssoundstrange because the world of quantum mechanics ‚Äî where things can exist in multiple states at once ‚Äîisstrange.\nThankfully, a group of students from TU Delft are bringing these powerful sub-atomic phenomena to life atTNW Conferencethrough an exhibition of abstract artworks.\nTheir project, Emergence Delft, blends science and creativity into a mind-bending exploration of quantum reality. A centrepiece of the exhibition is Coexist ‚Äî a mesmerising light installation that captures the elusive nature of quantum mechanics through colour, interaction, and design.\nAt its heart, Coexist tackles superposition, the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states at once. For instance, a qubit ‚Äî thequantumversion of a classical bit ‚Äî can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. But it doesn‚Äôt stay that way forever. The moment it‚Äôs observed, the qubit collapses into a single, definitive state ‚Äî a phenomenon known as the act of measurement.\nInside Coexist, a glowing white light ‚Äî which contains all visible colours ‚Äî symbolises superposition. Around it, oversized polarisation filters are arranged like futuristic portholes. As visitors peer through and rotate these filters, different colours are revealed, depending on how the filters interact with the light waves. Just like in quantum mechanics, the act of looking changes what you perceive.\nThe üíú of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

    "content": "This week on TNW Backstage, we‚Äôre heading into the fast lane ‚Äî and straight into the climate debate.\nIn the final episode of the podcast, we revisit a divisive bet on sustainable motorsport: Extreme E, the all-electric racing series.\nThe events sent SUVs hurtling through some of the planet‚Äôs most fragile ecosystems. Supporters said they raised awareness about environmental issues, while detractors called it a classic case of greenwashing.\nAt last year‚Äôs TNW Conference,¬†we were guided through the twists and turns by Ali Russell, then the managing director of Extreme E. In his talk, Russell laid out his vision for fighting climate change through high-octane racing. He pitched it as both a testing ground forEVinnovation and a global platform for environmental advocacy.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\nThe results? Mixed. While Extreme E broke new ground in EV performance and gender equity, critics poured scorn on its sustainability claims.\nAtTNW Conference 2025,we‚Äôll continue unpacking the tension between sustainability and innovation ‚Äî especially in the future of mobility.¬†Here‚Äôs a sample of what‚Äôs onthe agenda:\nAs for Extreme E, the series has now rebranded as Extreme H ‚Äî the first hydrogen-powered off-road racing championship. Want to hear what led to the pivot? Then listen to TNW Backstageon Spotify, on ourdedicated podcast site, or via the media player at the bottom of this article.\nWe created TNW Backstage to take you behind the scenes of TNW Conference ‚Äî and the tech shaping our world.

    "title": "WhatsApp Now Allows Users Forwarding Media To Meta AI For Analysis",
    "content": "WhatsApp is introducing a new feature that allows users to forwardphotos, videos, and texttoMeta AI, the platform‚Äôs integrated chatbot, for content analysis. Initiallyreleasedthrough thebeta channel (version 2.25.18.8 for Android), the feature is also gradually rolling out to some stable users.\nWith this new capability, Meta AI can analyze forwarded content to providecontextual information, such as identifying thelocation where a photo was taken,describing images,cross-referencing data, and evenverifying the authenticity of viral videos. This function aims to enhance the chatbot‚Äôs utility, especially for users seeking quick insights about media content.\nAccording to WhatsApp, the feature has potentialanti-misinformation benefits. By enabling users to verify forwarded content using Meta AI, the tool could become avaluable asset in combating fake news and misinformation, particularly in viral media shared across chats.\nIn terms ofprivacy, Meta AI only accesses contentexplicitly shared by the user. All shared data isend-to-end encryptedduring transmission and isdeleted from cloud serversafter processing. This approach is designed to maintain user trust and uphold WhatsApp‚Äôs strong privacy standards.\nTo use the feature, users canselect a photo or video, tap thesharebutton, and check ifMeta AIappears as a sharing option. If it does, the content can be forwarded directly to the chatbot for analysis and feedback.\nThis enhancement follows another recent update to WhatsApp, which introducednew animationsfor sending media, further improving the overall user experience. Additionally, WhatsApp is also testing anew method to copy message content, indicating the company‚Äôs broader effort to refine user interactions and expand the app‚Äôs functionality.\nThese updates reflect Meta‚Äôs ongoing push to integrate AI-driven tools across its platforms, with WhatsApp now becoming a more intelligent and interactive messaging environment.

    "content": "Microsoft has announced the launch of theBing Video Creator, a new tool thatuses artificial intelligence to generate short videos from text prompts. This release is seen as a direct response toGoogle‚Äôs recent unveiling of Veo 3with Flow at the AI25 event. Integrated into the Bing app for Android and iOS, the feature ispowered by Microsoft‚Äôs Sora AIand allows users tocreate videos for free.\nTo use the tool, users simply need to open the Bing app, tap on the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù tab, and select ‚ÄúVideo Creator.‚Äù From there, they can describe the scene they want to generate, including elements like setting, motion, and visual details. Once submitted, the AI begins generating the video, and users are notified when it‚Äôs ready‚Äîallowing them to multitask within the app in the meantime.\nThe Bing Video Creator supports videos up to five seconds long in both 9:16 (vertical) and 16:9 (horizontal) formats. Users can generate up to three videos at a time and choose between Standard or Fast creation speeds. Microsoft provides 10 fast-generation credits as a demo, and additional fast creations can be unlocked using Microsoft Rewards points.\nCreative prompts such as ‚Äúa small otter working as a chef in a busy Italian pizzeria‚Äù or ‚Äúa knight in armor riding his horse through an autumn forest‚Äù demonstrate the tool‚Äôs flexibility in supporting a wide range of visual styles and imaginative ideas.\nAll generated videos are stored in the Bing Video Creator for up to 90 days, during which users can download them, share on social media, or send via email. Importantly, each video includes C2PA credentials, clearly identifying it as AI-generated content‚Äîan effort aimed at promoting transparency and curbing misinformation.\nWith this release, Microsoft expands its footprint in the AI-generated media space and positions itself in direct competition with Google‚Äôs offerings.

    "content": "Googlehas begun rolling outautomatic AI-generated email summaries in the GMail app for Android and iOS. This update representsa shift from Gemini, Google‚Äôs AI assistant, being an optional feature to becoming a standard tool for certain users. The aim is to provide a quicker overview of long or multi-reply conversations without requiring manual input.\nPreviously,AI-generated summaries had to be triggered manually. Now, they appear automatically at the top of selected emails. The Gemini assistant determines when a summary is relevant based on the structure and content of the conversation. Typically, summaries are generated for extended email threads or discussions with numerous responses. These summaries are presented as concise bullet points and update dynamically as new messages are added to the conversation.\nInitially, this feature is being made available toGoogle Workspace users,Google One subscribers with the AI Premium plan, andusers with Gemini Education add-ons. For now, it islimited to emails written in Englishandonly available on mobile devices.\nUsers who prefer not to use AI summaries can opt out, but doing so comes with a trade-off. Disabling this feature requires turning off Gmail‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart features‚Äù entirely. This action also disables useful functionalities such aspriority notifications,package tracking,smart reply, andwriting suggestions.\nThe summarization feature is powered bylarge language models (LLMs)‚Äîthe same technology that underpins modern AI assistants and chatbots. These models analyze email content to generate summaries, and in turn, Google may use anonymized data from emails to improve its AI systems.\nBy introducing automatic AI summaries, Google signals a broader strategy to integrate generative AI into its core products. The update is part of an ongoing effort to enhance Gmail‚Äôs efficiency for users who manage high volumes of emails.

    "content": "According to a new report by cybersecurity firmNetskope,25% of European organizations have banned Grok, the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk. The data indicatesa significant level of distrusttoward Grok compared to other AI tools currently in use across Europe.\nBy comparison,OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, the most widely adopted AI application, is blocked by only9.8%of European firms, whileGoogle‚Äôs Geminiis restricted by9.2%. The discrepancy reflects growing scrutiny over how different AI platforms handlesecurity, privacy, and content moderation.\nGrok has recently come under fire forspreading misinformation, includingfalse narratives about a ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù in South Africaandquestionable claims related to the Holocaust. These incidents have prompted many organizations toopt for alternatives perceived as more secure and reliable.\nNeil Thacker, Global Privacy and Data Protection Officer at Netskope, explained that the bans reflect increasing corporate awareness arounddata privacy, model transparency, anddata usage policies. Businesses are beginning to distinguish between AI apps based on how responsibly they handle user inputs and data training practices.\nThe report also shows that91% of European organizationsnow utilize cloud-based generative AI chatbots, indicating widespread adoption of AI technology. However,usage is selective: some tools face resistance due tolicensing, transparency, or privacy concerns.\nStable Diffusion, the image-generation AI developed by UK-based Stability AI, holds the title of the most blocked AI app in Europe, restricted by41% of organizations. It is frequently flagged due toprivacy risks or ambiguous licensing practices.\nGianpietro Cutolo, a cloud threat researcher at Netskope, noted that organizations are becoming more sophisticated in assessing thesecurity risks of specific AI platforms. This growing caution is particularly visible in the case of Grok, which, despite being branded by Musk as a ‚Äútruth-seeking AI,‚Äù is losing credibility in the enterprise space.\nThe backlash against Grok comes amid broader reputational challenges for Musk, including a reported52% drop in Tesla‚Äôs sales in the EUlast month.

    "content": "A recent survey conducted byInteracfound that nearly nine in 10 Canadians (88 per cent) have used Interac e-Transfer, a money-moving service inCanada. Canadians continue to rely on this product to move $338billion over the past 12 months, and over $625billion since the pandemic began, with 49 per cent indicating that they have increased their use in this period.\nHowever, moving money beyond Canada is challenging. This is where integrating Z≈´m Rails‚Äô APIs into Western Union‚Äôs network is helpful. This will in turn enable the company to drive real-time movement of funds for Western Union customers using Interac eTransfer. With Interac eTransfer, customers can instantly fund their money transfers in Canada, then send the money to anywhere in the world.\nWith the rise of real-time payments and other digital experiences, consumers have become accustomed to sending and receiving money in seconds. However, speed is dictated by the payments rails technology integrated into a financial institution‚Äôs network. While new options have emerged to facilitate transactions in real-time, building the technology to integrate these rails and supporting compliance protocols into their existing infrastructures requires significant time and resources.\n‚ÄúOur work with Western Union reflects a larger trend across the payments industry, defined by real-time money movement as a non-negotiable service for consumers and enterprises alike,‚Äù saidMiles Schwartz, CEO atZ≈´m Rails.\n‚ÄúPartnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintechs are proving to be a catalyst in accelerating this trend.

    "title": "Leading a Unicorn: In Conversation With Haider Khan, CEO of Bayut and dubizzle",
    "content": "Haider Khanis the CEO of proptech companyBayut, as well asdubizzle, an online marketplace. He is also the head of UAE-based unicornDubizzle Group MENA.\nAside from leading one of the region‚Äôs few unicorns, Khan also boasts an impressive list of experience, having spent a short time atGoldman Sachs, before spending the next 14 years atNational InstrumentsandSilicon Laboratories.\nDuring this time, he worked on a wide range of large-scale projects, from working on 5G technology to sharing his expertise with theElon Musk-led space technology companySpaceX.\nThe technology leader eventually moved on to the UAE in 2014, where he has successfully scaled high-growth platforms, raised over $500million in funding, and led a landmark merger withOLXacross the UAE, Pakistan, Egypt, and Lebanon. Under his leadership, Dubizzle Group became a company valued at over $1billion.\nWe sat down with Khan to find out more about how he led Dubizzle Group to success, his engineering background, progress in the UAE, and his big plans for the future.\nReaching unicorn status was never the end goal ‚Äì it was a natural result of staying relentlessly focused on solving real consumer and business problems at scale. One of the most pivotal decisions we made early on was to double down on localisation. We didn‚Äôt just copy-paste global models ‚Äì we reimagined them for the unique nuances of the UAE.\nSecondly, we embraced tech as a core differentiator, not just a support function. By investing heavily in our AI and ML capabilities at a very early stage, launching problem-solving products like TruCheck, and then scaling that with proprietary tools like TruBroker, TruEstimate and ProConnect, and maintaining a laser focus on user trust and quality, we created platforms that are not only large in reach but deep in value.\nOur acquisition strategy has also played a critical role, bringing dubizzle into the fold and building a full-stack ecosystem across classifieds and proptech gave us the kind of operational and data synergy that few players can match.\nIt starts with listening. Every market has its own economic rhythms, user behaviours and trust barriers‚Äîso while the technology stack might be scalable, the go-to-market execution must be hyperlocal.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our local teams drive product-market fit with autonomy, but within the framework of a centralised innovation roadmap. That means we stay true to our mission‚Äîbuilding smarter ecosystems while giving our regional brands the freedom to innovate based on local feedback loops.\nOur unified vision acts as the North Star, but our strength lies in the adaptability of our routes to get there.\nMy engineering background taught me to break down complex problems and build solutions from the ground up. Whether it was working on 5G or at SpaceX, my mindset has always been the same: question everything, simplify where possible and focus on scalable outcomes that offer real value.\nThat approach has carried through into my work at Dubizzle Group. I always say this: I see technology as more than just a support tool. It‚Äôs a part of our DNA as an organisation, and it shapes how we solve problems for users, how we build trust and how we stay ahead.\nWe‚Äôve embedded this thinking into everything, from building AI tools like TruEstimate to introducing authentication features like TruCheck or agent recognition systems like TruBroker. It‚Äôs about using smart tech to create better experiences, not just faster ones.\nOne of the biggest advantages of the UAE is the constant thirst for exceeding expectations, a sentiment that I deeply resonate with. The UAE isn‚Äôt just participating in digital transformation ‚Äì it‚Äôs orchestrating it. What sets this region apart is its proactive policymaking and willingness to co-create with the private sector. Initiatives like the Dubai PropTech Hub and the Digital Economy Strategy reflect a bold vision to make this region a global tech powerhouse.\nFor tech companies, alignment means more than just regulatory compliance ‚Äì it‚Äôs about impact. We need to build with purpose: empowering SMEs, upskilling talent, and embedding sustainability and inclusion into our platforms.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our investments in AI, local talent, and ecosystem data transparency are all aligned with the UAE‚Äôs ambition to be not just digitally enabled, but digitally sovereign.\nThe next phase is about moving from platforms to ecosystems. We‚Äôre connecting the dots between discovery, transaction, and post-sale services to create seamless, trust-driven digital journeys, whether someone is buying a car, renting a home, or launching a business.\nAIis a big part of that future. Our ‚ÄòSell with AI‚Äô tool already allows users to list with intelligent suggestions in seconds. In under a month, we have had over 100,000 listings added to the platform with this smart assistant.

    "content": "Published in its2025 Great Britain Shopper Survey,Curinosuncovers that digital expectations, competitive switching offers and generational shifts in behaviour are reshaping loyalty in the retail banking landscape.\nKurt Vogt Gwerder, strategy consultant at Curinos, said:‚ÄúThe 2025 GB Shopper Surveyshows traditional banks still lead in customer acquisition. However, digital challengers are gaining influence. Customers are no longer staying with banks out of habit ‚Äì they‚Äôre switching for value.\n‚ÄúCash incentives still attract, but don‚Äôt guarantee satisfaction or loyalty. Digital challengers are building trust through better digital experiences and more relevant offerings, such as financial guidance. Promotions may draw people in, but only strong, engaging value propositions will keep them.‚Äù\nWhile the UK‚Äôs Big Seven banking providers remain the first stop for ‚Äònew-to-banking‚Äô customers (72 per cent), digital banks are making significant gains with more seasoned customers. In fact, 34 per cent of customers leaving a Big Seven bank switched to a digital challenger.\nNotably, 75 per cent of these switchers were moving for the first time since 2020, significantly above the market average of 62 per cent, highlighting a behavioural shift among long-term customers.\nAmong those switching from a Big Seven bank to a digital one, the top drivers of attrition were competitive offers (22 per cent) and dislike of their previous bank‚Äôs mobile app (18 per cent) and online banking (18 per cent).\nDigital banksnow acquire 59 per cent of their primary customers from switchers coming directly from the Big Seven. Despite this growing competition, the Big Seven banks continue to dominate, securing 61 per cent of primary current account openings over the past three years.\nThe majority of customers continue to prefer opening their account digitally (84 per cent), with smartphones (61 per cent) being the most preferred channel versus on a desktop (18 per cent) or via a tablet (five per cent).\nHowever, on average, 10 per cent of all recent account openers still prefer to set up their current account in person, with Boomers the generation most likely to prefer this option (23 per cent). Thirteen per cent of those new to banking are more likely to visit a branch to open an account, whilst 15 per cent of newcomers to the country are likely to do so. This demonstrates genuine demand for the service, suggesting branches remain a vital channel, particularly for interactions perceived as complex or stressful.\nFurthermore, the survey found that:\nThe Fintech Times",

    "content": "Cross-border transactions are costing companies over $120 billion per year in transaction fees, a report by Oliver Wyman and J.P. Morgan found. In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient.\nAlthough originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments.\nIt can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger.\nWithin B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes.\nAs blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point.

Some significant problems hindering this include:\nMost companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees.\nForeign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions.\nKey cost factors include:\nCross-border B2B payments are settled for an average of two to five business days, usually due to time zones, bank holidays, and manual authentication procedures. TheSWIFTnetwork, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays.\nThis inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. The rising cost of cross-border transactions has generated a need for alternative payment methods, such as stablecoins and blockchain settlements.Lack of Transparency\nMany standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking.

Regulations differ in each jurisdiction, and companies must go through a complex web of compliance requirements.\nSanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. The ever-changing nature of the regulations means that companies must continually update compliance systems, and this naturally adds to the expense of administrative costs and operating expenses.\nBlockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, andefficient payment systems. The biggest advantages of making use of blockchain-based B2B payments are:\nLowering Costs\nBlockchain eliminates the presence of intermediaries like correspondent banks, minimizing the cost of transactions in conventional payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly.\nFaster Settlement Times\nBlockchain payment technologies decrease cross-border payment delays from multiple days to just minutes, which unlike the multi-step payment processes of traditional payment systems, revolutionizes fintech cross-border innovation.\nThis is how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)facilitate faster paymentsbetween companies. Ethereum and Solana networks have been shown to be able to sustain high-speed, large-scale transactions without bank authorization, making them perfect for B2B settlements.\nTransparency & Security\nBlockchain employs a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store all the transactions in an open, fixed ledger. This degree of transparency thus enables businesses to see transactions in real-time, minimizing the scope for fraud and inefficiency in reconciliations. Compared to traditional banking infrastructure, where transaction histories might have been hidden due to banking regulations, blockchain provides an unerasable history of transactions.\nSmart Contracts\nBlockchain payment solutions can also facilitate compliance automation via smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded instructions to execute based on regulatory requirements.\nThe contracts can automate AML and KYC checks prior to a transaction,enhancing the regulatory complianceof blockchain payments.

Dive into how automation is reshaping the workforce:https://t.co/x3Fd60UKnM#AI#Automation#Economypic.twitter.com/JEwGeUkpc0\nHe\nurged businesses, governments and broader society to wake up and prepare for AI‚Äëdriven\njob disruption, warning its impact on white‚Äëcollar work ‚Äúusually leads to\nat least a recession in the short term.‚Äù He went on to say, ‚ÄúI want to be\nhonest, I want to be fair, and I want to tell what I see so that society can\nstart taking preparations.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs a pretty stark contrast from most corporate messaging, which tends\nto focus on ‚ÄúAI empowerment‚Äù and ‚Äúenhancing human potential.‚Äù Klarna‚Äôs boss is\nsaying: forget the buzzwords‚Äîthis could break the economy.\nNow, here‚Äôs where things get darkly humorous.\nAfter warning the world that AI is about to upend jobs and potentially\ncollapse economies, and after reversing course on AI customer service, Siemiatkowski went and made himself the star of... wait for\nit... Klarna‚Äôs AI-powered customer service hotline.\nCheck out this summarized news story üëÄKlarna‚Äôs CEO is now taking your calls ‚Äî over an AI hotlinehttps://t.co/WEjwbMvjIJ\nThe hotline allows customers to call Klarna and get a response from the\nCEO‚Äîsort of. When you ring up, you‚Äôre greeted by a synthesized version of\nSiemiatkowski‚Äôs voice, which cananswer\nquestions, resolve issues, and, we hope, crack a few jokes. It‚Äôs his voice,\npowered by AI, handling your mundane customer queries‚Äîbecause nothing says\n‚Äúhuman-centered leadership‚Äù like turning your CEO into a chatbot.\nKlarna claims that these chats could ‚Äútranslate into tangible product\nimprovements already the following day.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs a neat PR move. It‚Äôs also peak irony.\nKlarna‚Äôs whole business model hinges on fast, efficient digital\ntransactions‚Äîso embracing AI makes strategic sense. But Siemiatkowski‚Äôs\nwarnings reveal a deeper paradox haunting every tech-forward company: if you\ninnovate too fast, you risk contributing to the very economic instability\nyou‚Äôre trying to avoid.\nCan companies both adopt AI and avoid contributing to systemic\nunemployment? Is it possible to champion innovation without gutting the\nworkforce? Siemiatkowski seems to be asking those questions himself‚Äîbetween\nAI-powered customer calls, of course.\nSo is Sebastian Siemiatkowski the tech CEO we deserve‚Äîor the one we\nneed? On one hand, he‚Äôs voicing concerns most of his peers are too busy\npitching investor decks to address. On the other, he‚Äôs diving headfirst into\nthe same automation trend he‚Äôs warning us about.\nIn the race to dominate the future of fintech, Klarna is running full\nthrottle. But if its own CEO is right, the cost of that speed could be\nmassive‚Äîand felt far beyond the walls of any call center.",

In 2025, the focus is clear: make payments faster, more secure, and more integrated into people‚Äôs daily lives. Businesses and consumers alike are demanding smoother experiences, whether they‚Äôre shopping online, paying bills, sending money abroad, or managing subscriptions.\nAt the centre of this shift is technology. From real-time payment systems and digital wallets to AI-powered personalisation and biometric security, innovation is reshaping every part of the payment journey.\nLet's explore the top trends definingthe payments industry in 2025‚Äîfrom the rise of real-time global transactions and smart money management to the growing importance of digital identity and biometric security. These changes aren‚Äôt just shaping how money moves‚Äîthey‚Äôre reshaping what customers expect from financial services.\nToday‚Äôs users want more than just a place to store money‚Äîthey want tools that help them manage it better. Whether it‚Äôs tracking subscriptions, setting savings goals, or getting alerts on spending patterns, customers expect intuitive, in-app features that make daily money management easier. And if their provider doesn‚Äôt offer it, many are happy to switch.\nAccording to Visa and Tink, over 70% of consumers in Europe already use digital apps to manage their finances, and younger generations are leading the shift.\nThat‚Äôs why traditional banks and issuers are under pressure to deliver slick, mobile-first experiences‚Äîespecially as neobanks and fintechs raise the bar with fast, flexible services.\nReal-time payments (RTP) are becoming standard in many domestic markets, but the next frontier is cross-border. Businesses and individuals want to send money abroad as easily as they do within their own country‚Äîquickly, clearly, and at low cost.\nBut there‚Äôs a gap between what users expect and what they get. Many cross-border payments still take days, carry high fees, and lack transparency.Visaresearch found that 67% of marketplace sellers say slow payouts hurt their ability to do business. And only 2.3% of small businesses are satisfied with their current cross-border options.\nEfforts are underway to fix this. Global RTP initiatives, digital wallet innovation, andsolutions like Visa Direct aim to make cross-border transfers real-time, transparent, and seamless.

These biometric tools offer more convenience and stronger security, making it easier for users to confirm payments with a simple touch or glance.\nThe rise of subscription services has changed how people spend, but also introduced new pain points‚Äîlike forgotten renewals or hidden charges. Half of UK consumers want banks to help manage their subscriptions, with tools to flag recurring charges and cancel unwanted payments.\nBy adding these features, banks and payment providers can boost engagement and show they care about users‚Äô actual financial needs, not just transactions.\nMore payment experiences are now built directly into apps and platforms. Whether it‚Äôs paying in a ride-sharing app or getting a loan during checkout, embedded finance is becoming part of everyday commerce. At the same time, Account-to-Account (A2A) payments are gaining ground, offering a direct, cost-effective way to move money without using cards.\nBut with new channels come new risks.

    "title": "How SS&amp;C Intralinks is driving growth in Asia with AI-powered M&amp;A and seamless alternative investment fund management",
    "content": "Despite rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty around US policy, M&A and financing professionals remain optimistic about dealmaking in APAC. This confidence reflects the upbeat sentiment at the start of the year where 94% of respondents in the SS&C Intralinks ‚Äò2025 APAC M&A Dealmakers Sentiment Report,‚Äô produced with Reuters, anticipated increased deal activity, with nearly half predicting significant growth.\n‚ÄúThis tells us there was confidence and a renewed appetite for growth,‚Äù said Alex Turner, Vice President, Sales - Asia Pacific, at SS&C Intralinks. While the report was published before the latest bout of volatility, growth in early-stage M&A and fundraising activity continues. ‚ÄúDealmakers are preparing to launch projects once the market settles.‚Äù\nTurner‚Äôs view reflects conducive conditions for deals ‚Äì from more stable interest rates in key markets, to growth in China+1 supply-chain strategies, to plans to put dry powder to work. ‚ÄúAs a result, we expect there will be a shift from middle-market deals to larger, high-value deals this year,‚Äù explained Turner.\nAt the same time, deal financing remains a key challenge, he added. ‚ÄúOver half of the dealmakers we surveyed expect financing conditions to become more difficult over the next year, with 28% identifying it as the most challenging aspect of dealmaking.‚Äù\nThis is no surprise. Today‚Äôs high-pressure environment may be more intense than ever, with economic volatility, geopolitical tensions and fragmented regulations compounding already tight deal timelines. Adding to the challenge is the exponential growth of the volume of data involved in due diligence ‚Äî leaving little room for inefficiency.\nA more intelligent approach to doing deals\nSS&C Intralinks has spent years developing proprietary AI models and technologies to bring powerful, deal-ready innovation to its clients. In today‚Äôs environment, AI-driven insights are no longer optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential to getting deals get done so firms can begin driving value from day one.\n‚ÄúThose who can move quickly while making informed choices and demonstrating control over their data and workflows gain a real competitive edge,‚Äù explained Turner.\nThe ability to efficiently ingest, analyse and act on an overwhelming volume of information through automation can help to alleviate many bottlenecks that have traditionally slowed down transactions, he added. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs consolidating and analysing massive volumes of due diligence data, streamlining investor communication, or maintaining full visibility across complex deal structures, smarter workflows are enabling teams to work faster and more confidently across borders and stakeholder groups.‚Äù\nUsing AI is becoming essential to meet evolving expectations from investors, advisors and regulators in terms of real-time reporting and auditable transparency. In fact, 98% of respondents in the survey said they expect AI-powered tools in M&A and financing to increase in the coming year.\nYet with adoption in its early stages, the goal is to find the right partners and solutions that offer robust AI features plus align with the regulatory and security requirements of a specific industry.\n‚ÄúThis is one of the key reasons the next generation of the SS&C Intralinks platform has been built to fully integrate AI into the tools, analytics and workflows used by dealmakers in DealCentre AI‚Ñ¢,‚Äù said Turner.\nFinding new ways to fuel fundraising\nSpeed and transparency have become increasingly key success factors for fundraising, too.\nAccording to Turner, a mindset shift among fund managers has led to an increasing focus on managing the entire experience for limited partners (LPs) and other investors end-to-end, from fundraising to onboarding to reporting.\n‚ÄúAs fundraising cycles lengthen and investor attention becomes more fragmented, general partners (GPs) need to offer a more personalised and intuitive investor experience that builds trust throughout the entire fundraising cycle,‚Äù he added.\nUltimately, the fund managers that will thrive in this environment are the ones that treat fundraising as more of a dynamic and data-informed process that moves with the investor and the market.\nThis will therefore meet the increasingly selective approach LPs are taking when it comes to the quality, transparency and timeliness of information they receive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that level of visibility that gives them the confidence to commit capital,‚Äù Turner added.\nLiving up to changing expectations\nAs AI becomes more embedded in dealmaking and fundraising, technology needs to feel intuitive and purposeful. Achieving this will close the gap between what Turner calls ‚Äúthe promise of AI and the day-to-day reality for most teams‚Äù.\nThis is the foundation of thoughtful guidance and partnership, aimed at achieving key goals such as:\nUnderpinning the solutions, however, is a commitment to service, said Turner. ‚ÄúTechnology is essential, but one of our most valuable differentiators is the depth of our industry expertise. Having supported trillions in transactions, our experience shapes every decision we make ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what keeps us at the forefront of innovation in dealmaking.‚Äù\nClick here for more details onSS&C Intralinks,DealCentre AIandFundCentre‚Ñ¢\nReference sources",
